522,2,It's like one long un-ending episode of The Office.,"Known Brand. Interesting opportunities for growth and some acquisiton, but hopefully they've learned their lesson about how to acquire companies cleanly and not blatantly disrespect the incoming employees.","If I had to listen to one more bad sports/height joke I would have just thrown out my laptop. Nothing is efficient. Things take forever to get approved or be completed. We were forced to sign new contracts over a holiday weekend, no access to lawyers. Everyone thinks they're a hot shot. CEO left on our first week, people cried. There was some koolaid drinking going on that is sorta creepy."
738,5,Good,"Great pay, very good benefits.",None that I experienced while working here.
741,2,"Great team, poor management","- Genuinely customer-focused legal team 
- Direct team had a great culture and goals 
- Tabcorp was genuine in harm-reduction and making sure they do the right thing
- CEO is well regarded amongst the team 
- Above average remuneration","- Poor leadership within legal with our team leaders not being given the support they required from the Group General Counsel. 
- GGC was erratic and was more of a lone wolf method than giving support to our team 
- Tabcorp leadership was not supportive during COVID, and rather than support the team during COVID, made it our problem, with the company finances being first. 
- Lack of career development, with outside talent being preferred 
- Outdated systems and process, which resulted in burn-out and lack of work-life balance
- Work was very focused on putting out fires"
661,4,Amazing company that I was proud to work for.,"Amazing IP, products and benefits. Competitive pay. The opportunity to work with the best in the industry.",Managers didn't manage anything but their own careers. Massive communication issues between business sections. Reluctance or slow to embrace competitive cutting edge technology and ideas in parks.
412,2,No a good company,The environment of the office is good,"Always OT working, low salary pay"
679,1,Terrible,If you are in the in crowd you can do anything you want,Cut throat and everyone will throw you under the bus
627,1,Business Analyst,"Flexible working conditions, friendly staff","Senior management, communication, office politics"
514,2,Great if you have no previous experience and can take abuse.,"a good challenge to learn product and keep up to date, compensation, internal training.  If you are a very compliant rule-follower devoid of creativity or ambition, this job is for you.",very political environment.  Internal company relationships trump capabilities every time.  No career path.  The Peter Principle seems to apply for sure.    Stay away from the Anaheim office if you must work for Extron.
860,1,Aucun,Je ne vois pas d’avantages mais des inconvénients,"Salaire

Supérieur 
Ecoute relation et affaire"
137,2,Yet another Service Based company calling itself a Product based company,"Although the pros are less than it's cons but they are to be listed:

1. The new office in Phase 3 (there are more cons on this too) 

2. Lot to learn as a Software Developer (if you are in the right place)","This would be more interesting to talk about:

- It works like a typical Service based company despite calling itself a product company.

- The so-called products are purely developed as per clients' requirements (projects). So if the same idea is to be used for a different client, everything starts from scratch.

- The Business Leaders (or the VP's) hold too much power. They can hire, fire, speak rudely(even abuse), or impose sanctions without any show cause or review. The Business leaders in KPIT(VPs or AVPs) decided by their tenure of service (15+years) OR nepotism.

- Hike is not connected to performance, it is connected to how much one is drawing. For eg. for Freshers, it would be high(~20%-30%) whereas for experienced it would be(~5%-8%). They may not choose to give a hike at all.

- The company posted Quarter on Quarter profits during CoVid -19 but despite that, they had to impose salary cuts and surgical layoffs.

- Leaves and salary are deducted if one even forgets to fill time-logs. There's no benefit of the doubt at all.

- HRs have no say in anything. VPs are the final point of decision.

- 3 level approvals for eveything, for even getting a site unblocked."

637,4,Optanix review,"Innovative SW platform
High Profile Clients","Aggressive schedules
Sr Management lacked skills needed to deliver and maintain employees"
974,4,Best Staffing Firm Experience,"- The HR team is pretty good at responding and maintaining effective communication with the employee 
- The recruitment/onboarding team is above par in making the candidate onboarded by providing necessary instructions 
- The immigration team was knowledgeable and helped me getting H1B approval for a transfer petition even though I received an RFE for a critical factor
- Employees get good benefits from both health insurance that covers both dental, vision (have multiple options), offered 401K plan, and provided 13 days of PTO for an year which will get accrued for every pay cycle",- Doesn’t have a well defined Marketing Team to find another job for a candidate soon when the project ends
939,1,"Abandon hope, ye who enter here ...","At this point, few to none.  A port in a storm, if you can't find anything else. Free parking, soft drinks and coffee, and fruit.","Long hours, no rewards for rowing a galley with no rudder or compass. Lack of product vision, direction, and fewer and fewer competent resources to achieve even keeping the boat afloat, much less moving forward. Customer churn is significant. Stability is much more of a fantasy than a dream."
900,1,Flexible but they are hypocritical politicians,"Flexible for those with multiple jobs, other obligations, family, etc. Great benefits for those who choose to be full time. Occasional employee events that are enjoyable. They offer promotions if you've stayed and acted like a good dog for enough time. Most of the server/food &amp; Bev employees make great peers","Hours are not guaranteed, as they will often cut them short and cancel/change your shift last minute without a proper notice that they need to rearrange somethings, so you're check is never consistent if you're not pushed into being full time for that reason. Tips are included in a gratuity but is only distributed quarterly and how convenient for them that it leaves the employees with a vague idea and understanding of how accurately they’re splitting that and then its labeled as a “bonus” as if we should be grateful for what we rightfully earned, while most employees if not full time (which is a miserable scenario for most who did it) are still barely covering their costs as most of us had second and third jobs to make up for when hours are cut short which was an unpredictable weekly occurance at times. They hire ANYONE . From addicts to sexual abusers to men threatening to shoot up the place, there is no background checks to protect their employees from the consequences of lacking that part of the hiring process. They gaslight the rest of the team when we DO speak up about those consequences and minimize , invalidate and dismiss those concerns until a member of the club themselves notices and vocalizes the problem , and then it gets taken out on us as if we we're the ones to fail them. The same manager enforcing ""zero tolerance"" rules is the same one laughing it off when one of the servers drops their bag of marijuana on the member dining floor. It's not surprising why their turnover is ridiculously high. They chase out quality people with irresponsible and insensitive behavior and then the ones they have left they will sell short unless confronted. They will fault you for the same things they let others get away with, especially between men vs women. (The managers who the most in charge of running the place and handle employees are men) If you come to them about an uncomfortable situation, they will give you a political reaction &amp; send you off with something to distract yourself with untill the problem reoccurs and is delivered by a man or white person. Their awareness and advocacy for diversity is performative &amp; evident with experience."
281,3,Work hard unappreciated,The pros are you enhance your skills with speed being able to work on a very tight time schedule people skills customer relation and merchandising.,When you're there if you're good at your job you are overworked under appreciated underpaid some stores are different but at the store I worked at it's not it was horrible
884,1,avoid this place,"some really smart and hard working people work here

They're really trying with DEI - i wouldn't say its going well, but they're trying","This place is toxic and an absolute mess. There are so many leaders here that should not be leaders - they are wildly unqualified and fail to grasp the basics of their role. These people create an endless amount of meaningless work in order to try to prove their relevancy. These leaders are causing the sparse remaining talent to leave in droves. 

When i spoke up to my manager about my profound unhappiness in my role due to micromanagement and being over worked - i was questioned about what was going on outside of work to cause such stress for me. It was never accepted or acknowledged that Collibra was the problem, and it was implied that it was my fault or my personal life that was prohibiting me from thriving here. I was told to feel empowered speak up about being underwater, but every time i spoke up i was told to have growth mindset. This place made me feel like a failure, but in hindsight i was set up to fail. Any ideas or thoughts I shared about changing process or questioning the status quo was met with confusion at best, or hostility &amp; patronization at worst. 

I have been removed from this company for enough time to reflect upon my experience at Collibra clearly, and I can confidently say this was the worst experience of my professional life. The BOH systems are absolutely not in the place they need to be for a company of this size (far too much is still managed in excel or google sheets). Different teams are in different places with the quality of their data and systems which makes it incredibly challenging (read impossible) to work cross functionally. Over the two years I spent here - nothing changed, nothing improved. 

There is no clarity on the strategic plan or long term vision, it feels like everyone is constantly putting out fires and not spending any time thinking about how to prevent fires.

Oh.. and stop being cheap. Pay people what they deserve and give teams the resources they need to be successful."
762,4,Partner Manager,"-Good working environment
-Good opportunity for growing your proffesional career
-Good salary","-Sometimes you have to work extra hours
-You have to deal with some customers' mind changes"
320,1,Worst organization ever.,There are no pros in this company.,No work life balance. Promotions are granted not on the basis of merit but on flattery. Salaries are pathetic.
550,2,Only numbers matter,"Bonuses, only after being forced to reach sales goals.","They don't care about employees, only care about numbers."
175,1,Awful,"Best patients around, fulfilling work",Management is awful. The worst I have ever seen.
372,3,Manager,"Competitive salary, good benefits, 50% discount on wireless products & service.",Only interested in promoting those under 50. Promotions are not regularly based on merit. Outsourcing or eliminating many jobs for experienced workers. Extremely interested in milennial customers and employees only.
528,2,Not a great one to start your career,Clients are good and can learn lots of things from them.,"Work pressure, management is not good and salary is low comparitively"
211,1,Worst company to work with,Just Salary on Time Thats it!!,Rest Everything Specially Office Politics and bad management
236,5,Great place to work,"Good environment and friendly colleagues. 
Challenging projects and technologies",Work overtime sometimes in some projects
102,4,Good company to work for,Good pay and benefits along with OT compensation,Long hours and weekends can wear on you
987,3,My exeperince in Alliance International,Market leader and intrenational company,"big hierarchy, no big possibility for promotion. They prefer to take new people than to promote own loyal once"
903,1,Clueless upper management,People are nice and genuinely care.,"No focus. Executives have no clue what the rest of the group is doing; for an organization this small, that’s inexcusable. No game plans among the functional units.  Employees that work with students every day (program managers, instructors, IAs) are often seen as unimportant. 
The model Pursuit uses (the Pursuit Bond) is really no different than a typical income-share agreement at General Assembly, Flatiron School, etc. and at least at those places you learn from a better established curriculum and larger support system."
948,1,Worst Career Advancement Ever,Good Benefits - but not enough to makeup for poor comp,"Do not expect to advance at IHS Markit. You better be happy where you come in at. 

Low pay"
347,2,Teller,The benefit package is great. There's a lot of hardworking and very good at their job people that work. You meet all kinds of people from every circle of life.,"The bank is turning into a retail store. Its more concern with sale goals instead of  the people that bank there. they give no regards to forcing old accounts into new accounts by changing the qualifications of maintaining the account. The hours of banking are not realistic dues to the fact that processing is closed at 4p.m. and workers have little to no time to balance life and work. Sale goals aren't realistic I'm got against growth but not all the products  don't work for everyone  for an example   an 82 yr old customer who enjoys coming to the bank to do all his/her banking needs and have no clue about the internet will not use online banking  because when u know the customer well enough it makes no sense to pressure him/her into getting it. Also if you don't meet goals for the week prior be prepared for an extra early meeting as to why you haven't and still have to work a full shift following it. Retail and banking is different, your customers don't need so many accounts. Wells Fargo taken out all the joy of going to work with a smile to everyday over worked, stressed and  wondering if you'll have a job."
140,1,One of the worst MNC to work for... one of the mistakes of my life,"There is hardly a plus point... the India Unit of shared services GCC will be look good from outside, but from inside it has more pathetic work environment.","Company will first behave like they are result oriented, then when you give more than 100% of the result, they will try to point out the fault in your ways of working (even if it is followed from inception) they will somehow try to prove that whatever you did is not worth it...

The Management is like kid, if you take any decisions on your own for the benefit of company and it does not involve your immediate line manager then your project your career is in danger... in short your sense of ownership can ruin your career in the so called result oriented product based company (you also might have to face termination)

GCC do not consider loyalty of a consistent performing person, even though you might have given 10years of your life to the organisation... of the management decided to kick you off they will do that by hook or by crook... in short there is 0% job security in ABInBev..

I would suggest even if you don’t have job in hand then also do not consider any offer from GCC... better  wait instead of playing with your career..

Worst Management and HR ever in my experience till date... Till the time HR was with Accenture it was nice.

Office politics is so much so that Indian politics is also seems better place...

Apart from formal work attire and GCC office infrastructure, there is nothing which should attract you."
622,2,Processes are more important than employees,"Working on the corporate side as a Recruiter, I had a pretty stable position, because the turnover rate in retail banking was so high.",HSBC didn't really value employees and they made it tougher and tougher each year for the retail banking staff to earn bonuses.
500,3,An ever changing workplace,"Lots of great people who are very passionate about the brand and making it a success. Made a lot of great friends working here. 
Fun product and photoshoots, great content to work with although it has its limitations in today's censored world. 
Personal pro - survived many redundancies.","The company changed hands many times during the time i was there. Each time with the brands changing direction. It became and ever evolving struggle to keep the brand feeling authentic when it was so hard to promote it in a commercial world. it's history is niche and underground - Trying to promote that was an issue with so much restrictions on nudity and 'adult sites'. 

When i started there were many toxic individuals in senior positions. over time they left and it became a much nicer environment to work in.

Then it was bought by four marketing and then that came with a whole new host of problems. AP faced a lot of direction from present agency (four marketings creative agency) and they did not care about the knowledge AP staff had on the brand / customer. There was a lack of collaboration or even independence. They ridiculed people, teams and interrogated individuals on their skills. Two men from Present acted like misogynistic babies and would at time throw a fit and storm out of meetings. I'm under the impression that these people have now left the business so hopefully not a problem anymore."
371,5,Company that believe in growing together with it's employee,"- Working on latest and greatest Tech stack 
- Hips of opportunity to learn new things 
- Best team culture to work with 
- Big company giving you opportunity to move around different teams time to time, helping you take up on different challenges and grow
- Best work life balance
- Opportunity to pursue different career path in case if you are interested","- Decent but not so great salary package 
- Too many layers of processes which sometime gives you limited freedom but CBA being the top of big 4 banks, needs to have such processes which can safeguard us and customer against damages"
199,3,Internal project work culture is toxic,Company policies are good. Work infrastructure is good. Caring disabled is good.,Work culture is toxic in terms of people in the project. They are selfish and reluctant to share knowledge to new joiner. Even project manager is not able to support in providing the complete KT in proper way. They are more interesting in blaming and criticising the new employee rather than helping.
688,1,No Leadership,There is an intent to drive work life balance. This they do an OK job at.,Lack of Executive Leadership creates lots of confusion. The relationship of the leadership and the Board of Governors is very contentious.
585,1,good pay poor culture,the pay and the benifits,very toxic place to work
902,5,"great culture, great colleagues, great product","Strong mission-driven culture. Almost without exception, colleagues are nice, smart, and hard-working.","As a consultant, you are often at the mercy of the client's pace / vision, which can be frustrating."
60,3,Not bad,Good relationship with customers and calm your self,To make custom happy with service
329,1,Good if you play the game,"People on the team were generally friendly, although there were some extremely, unpleasant personalities.","You will not be able to get any assignment (or some demanding clients) if the team dislikes you. The communication if Munck Wilson Mandala team in involved is not transparent. You might have worked hard but no appreciation from the management, only blames or accusations will be received. Hands down the most disappointing years of my career spent here."
97,4,É excelente pra início de carreira,"- Pra quem está começando a carreira é uma grande escola
- Se você trabalha em área digital, TI ou produtos você tem muita possibilidade de crescimento.
- Benefícios são muito bons
- Salário é bom quando você negocia bem
- A possibilidade de fazer networking é enorme dado a quantidade de funcionários e contato com diversas áreas
- Se você sabe jogar bem o jogo fazendo um bom trabalho e sendo política, vai se dar muito bem","- Com o passar do tempo a cultura faz com que você queira sair ou com que você não seja um profissional tão bom quanto eles pedem. Ex: querem que você seja questionador, pero no mucho.
- As carteiradas de pessoas do cargo acima do seu também são frequentes, fora a politicagem, são poucos os casos onde você consegue ser você mesmo e ter a possibilidade de crescer.
- Não vejo muita oportunidade para pessoas introvertidas, ou você joga o jogo ou não vai crescer como deseja."
313,5,Good Part Time Job,Getting to work with motivated students,Hours are not very flexible
975,1,Best Place to Get Depressed,"You get to see the directors and CEO threatening to sue the sales agents or managers if you speak anything that is opposite of what they want to hear. Agents getting terminated for trumped up charges is one of the best entertainment you can get here.
You also get to learn how to amortise a mortgage which is their main sales pitch to position themselves as Accountants. But I Guess they are not aware of Apps out there that explains their 30 min presentation in 15 seconds. But I digress. You will get to learn how a 1950s HP 12C calculator works. That’s quite rare in this digital age.","I tried to boot lick my way to the top there. Backstabbed a few friends here and there. I even threatened my own agents who wanted to leave with a lawsuit as taught by my Boss. But alas, he still suspected me and schemed to wreck my finances and career. First he terminated my MDRT agent based on some lame charge. I guess I deserve it for making a deal with the devil"
300,4,"3 years of experience, multi tasking, interested in technology.","TP is innovative, supportive and a respectful place to work at.",not having many back office accounts.
278,2,High turnover,Creative colleagues and business travel,Poor work environment and hours
925,4,Great company to work,"1. Work life balance
2. Get opportunity to work in different different technologies
3. No work load
4. On time to time different different type of activities was organised in which you can take participants.",Didn’t find any such cons due to which you can’t join this organisation.
602,4,Good First Job,"Pay Rate, Overtime, Weekly Incentives","Unsympathetic Management, On-Call, Haughty Customers"
440,1,Not recommending anyone to apply,I was thankful for them accepting me for the position because at that time I was desperately in need of a job.,"Everything being said to potential recruits are very different to what they'd actually get. The company is full of secrets and they don't show transparency to anyone. It takes long for them to release claims and benefits to the employees, and I'm not recommending anyone to apply here."
838,3,Ok place to work,"Flexible working
Good working environment
Good benefits","Hierarchical 
So large - hard to make a difference"
571,3,Good for Corporate Experience,"Lots of different jobs to apply to, decent pay (lower than MRP) and work from home opportunities","No promotions (you have to apply to different jobs), financial bottom line is the priority, culture is fake (straight out of an HR textbook)"
880,5,Fintech Company,Great working culture.  Very good reputation.,Hard to get in.  Tough selection criteria
262,3,No Maker and checker on day to day decisions,Job security and balanced life if you can manage work,"Immediate managers are too powerful to handle, HR is gone case, No exception approved no matter of you are dying. Fearless Biased approach of manager as HR has no clue."
579,1,nothing to say here,Made lots of friends and had a ball with all the people who made the working day great,work was hard … nothing more to to say
24,2,"Great place to learn, bad place to work.","Huge brand name.
Great learning experience.
Good canteen facility.","Very low salary compared to market.
No growth opportunities.
Politics, favouritism, bad working environment."
31,2,Poor Management,"Health Plan, benefits, Office, Snacks","Micro Management
Low Salary
Constant Performance Reviews"
618,5,Ilmor Excellence,"Great job Security, Competitive wages, Super Cool Products, Excellent Co-workers. Ilmor offers many employee perks to show their appreciation. Many other reviews on Glassdoor are inaccurate by giving low stars. Ilmor is one of the best companies I've ever worked for. Be prepared to be challenged to the max, but the outcome can be satisfying and rewarding. Some of my best memories include working for Ilmor.","Tight timelines, Work-life balance is heavily weighed towards work, Large gap between working level and management level."
11,3,Don't expect to advance at your home store,They are okay to work for.,Don't expect to be treated fairly from District and General Managers
222,2,Toxic,offers good benefits and is a teaching hospital,"toxic environment staff does not want to train new nurses because there is a fast turnover of new graduate nurses. New graduate nurses don't stay because of inadequate training. Nurses at the facility do not specialize in the OR. One day you can be circulating general and the next you'll be scrubbing orthopedics cases. Management does not hold surgeons accountable for abusive behavior such as verbal abuse, and unprofessional conduct and speech. Abuse of systems. Management abuses the staff. Lots of last minute mandations, cases are booked as emergencies when they are not so staff gets mandated and on call staff gets called in often for non-emergent cases. Decent benefits but not very competitive for what is out there and pay is not competitive. Manager is hands off and displays inappropriate conduct especially when nurses resign. He frequently says ""staff don't leave their jobs, they leave their bosses"". He asked a nurse in a interracial relationship to leave her husband because they were moving across. He pretended to be concerned for her safety claiming "" Haitian men have a reputation of being abusive and controlling and that she could use this as her way out of his relationship. He claimed to have gone threw something similar. He lies to staff about minimum resignation requirements to get them to stay longer. He claims they will not be paid of any of their PTO if they leave with a 3 weeks notice. Also has a reputation of giving negative job performance reviews to keep operating room staff for transferring to different units so their is no room for growth in the organization. Work life balance non exsistent. You work 5 days a week and get 2 days off but one of those days your on 15 minute - 1 hour call for 24 hours which means you need to camp out at the hospital. (hospital infested with large flying roaches). You have to taken call a minimum of twice per month. No consecutive days off."
821,2,Terrible Union backing you up here!!!!,"Now that they have moved to a new location, and the picking sequences have changed... it's a less work load.","As mentioned before, There is more to work for now. There's no gap in your work performance. Congrats Pepsico; you have found a way to work the human body to pure robotics. Don't show your human emotion. It'll go against the whole construct. Look! I'm not here to talk you out of a job. Just see for yourself. Besides... I have a grievance that was never resolved. By law, I should sue them... but where is that going to get me? Hence the pro of the union... get it? Got it?....good!"
297,5,Outstanding company with great growth potential,"New headquarters downtown Minneapolis
Experienced executive team
Great growth opportunities",Decision making by committee can make impact feel slow
55,3,Good pay/benefits,"Really good benefits including healthcare, vacation time, sick time etc.","Majority of the time you are dealing with more than 3 things at once especially when understaffed, the training never ends (new training almost every month), 30 minute breaks, customers can be really rude at times, too many responsibilities for the pay."
543,2,Company s profile and ethics,"1. For freshers and Interns can learn lot , coz there is no process and restrictions 2. you can get any kind of access to explore yourself into your domain.
3.You get work life balance better .
4.Flexible timings 
5.You can work by your own with the boundaries , ie.,timeline , target .","1. No process ,
2. Not good for experienced and mgt oriented people.
3. Vision and mission is not into great path .
4. Deficiency of projects
5. They lose gem of people , and wont retain or to keep right people."
210,5,Private Banking Career,JPMorgan Chase offers excellent benefits to their employees. You will find a great balance in your work/family life. This company provides a career path for their employees. Great commission opportunity,"You will find the hourly pay to be on the low side. The corporate red tape is everywhere, so if you like freedom and flexibility in the workplace, this is not the right fit. They focus more on political agendas than business agendas within the corporation."
605,1,Stay away from the London office,"Decent benefits. Nice offices, real potential","The London loan processing team is anything but agile, no self organisation within team, no autonomy, very much top down micro management. The team lead and other team managers are playing manipulative games behind your back, you cannot trust them, unless of course you do as they say, then you’re probably fine. You’ll be expected to work lots of overtime and deliver to totally unrealistic timeframes, etc. Management in this team are out for themselves, be very very careful if you end up here."
693,2,Company run by underpaid interns,"Great people, good opportunity for interns to lean lot's of skills in short amount of time","Company is run by interns, horribly underpaid, bad management, valuable people don't stay in the company because the money they get offered after the internship is a joke, employees and interns are being treated as enemies"
663,1,Don't do it to your career,They will throw a lot at you but...,"It's not worth it. 
The CEO and the two other directors are the worst people I have ever had the misfortune to work for. They do a great sales pitch at interview but once the honeymoon period is over they will work you until you break.
The turnover of staff for such a small company is staggering and most employees don't last a year. 
The CEO is manipulative and a bully. He frequently undermines and screams at people in meetings the other two directors just let him. 
More worryingly however is the way he treats female employees. I've heard him make and seen him send inappropriate remarks to female employees on multiple occasions. How he thinks he can behave like that in 2022 is beyond belief. 
I strongly recommend anyone who interviews with this company to look a little bit deeper on some of the claims they make about the business and it's success- there is a lot of smoke and mirrors going on here."
867,1,"Garbage place, CEO is absolutely nuts","Bad pay, no benefits, insane hours, and CEO fires people like crazy. She is so worried about competition that she tries to ruin anyone she sees as a threat. DO NOT WORK HERE!",Please look at Pros list
71,2,If you want to make money…,"If you want to grow, you just have to ask and you’ll probably start getting trained to level up.","There’s a lot. First- Wages. It’s heartbreaking to see how much the cost of living has increased in Idaho-where they’re head quartered- and have made almost no increases to wages. Most hourly jobs base pays are 15-25% lower than the market average, which you can look at from their HR page. Some how they keep bringing on new clients and can’t figure out how to budget for more people at higher wages. When covid hit and fast food restaurants started posting their new pay at $14+ they still haven’t found a way to accommodate and adjust the pay for their employees. The benefits are not great- but that’s intentional. They market how they can save companies money on health insurance by making very high deductibles and out of pocket maxes; it’s silly to think they wouldn’t use that on their own company. They made it seem like getting bought by Anthem would be so beneficial for everyone but years later- still no changes in pay or benefits. They can’t keep up with their work load so they’ve started outsourcing to “back fill” for some teams but my guess is that those teams will end up becoming fully outsourced. Anthem is going to steamroll Ameriben and my guess is within the next 5 years (if that) Ameriben will cease to exist."
544,5,Best company to work for!!,great pay opportunities for growth Company growing fast Supportive staff,General start up challenges that every company has
108,4,"Great Opportunities, Great People","• Coworkers are very knowledgeable. Senior employees will often juggle their responsibilities in addition to providing guidance whenever you need it.

• Company ""Peloton"" awards (company-wide acknowledgement, gift card) can be granted from any employee to another for recognizing great work.

• It is a smaller company with a tight-knit ""family"" feel, you get to know everyone from new hires to the president. Regular happy hours, ping pong/foosball, ""President's Club"" trips (normally all-inclusive to Mexico with significant others if company numbers are met annually), recreational sports, etc. help build and maintain friendships.

• As an Oracle/Google partner, there is 100% probability of working with large, exciting organizations on a regular basis. 

• Consulting allows you to work on multiple projects simultaneously, and switch to new projects regularly, which accelerates learning and introduces you to a wide variety of technologies.","• As a small company that supports many products, you will naturally need to wear a lot of hats and fill in to projects based on the demand of the sales pipeline. It is difficult to become a true expert or keep up with the latest released features in a few products when you need to focus 20-40 hours/week on unrelated products for another project. Because of this, you tend to be a more reactive resource in sales calls or new projects rather than a proactive authority.

• Work from home options have started to be introduced, but remain limited and restrictive.

• A significant portion of your pay comes from an ""Incentive Bonus"", where the only metric to meet the bonus is billing hours to a client project. The idea makes sense at a high level, but is a detriment to other initiatives within the company like supporting the sales team, internal infrastructure / demo environment maintenance, product development, training and certifications, documenting standard practices, and management / mentorship responsibilities."

In the past two years, it’s gotten so much worse! They are understaffed due to the toxicity… leaving new employees untrained and confused or current employees changing positions, to figure out their job on their own. 
You will be overworked, overwhelmed and then some of the management will jab with negative comments creating more stress. They should take this time to use as training or learning, but instead, they jab.

And heaven you get the clients that want to cancel and get clients that can’t pay due to financial issues like job loss or even homelessness.

The overwhelming workload situation was brought up every single week to the senior staff and no visible changes were made in over a year. On top of that, there are virtually no promos or proper salary raises, even though the account keeps growing every single year. 
It's a constant battle to try to get as little as a 5% - 10% raise for anyone on the team, which is exhausting and discouraging for everyone.

The recent annual bonus and profit sharing amounts have been generous.","Never got a chance to be proactive. The project was based on 2 third-party software applications that were over-customized to perform tasks it was never originally intended to perform. The original installation was held together with Unix shell scripts and manual efforts assigned to the off-shore development team. Further enhancements continue to strain these delicately-balanced fixes. Immediate project management only got involved during a system incident (which occurred nearly monthly); otherwise, they were nowhere to be seen or heard from. Promotions did not appear to be merit-based, but whether you were a part of the good old boy network. Newer cubicles are now smaller: in my area, an aisle of 15 cubicles were resized to 19 cubicles."

It was a nightmare for employees."
523,1,Culture Ruined by New CEO,"Subsidized cafeteria lunch and free espresso machines, when in the office.","Like most of the recent reviewers, my view is that the new CEO, hired in late 2017 from Harman to cut costs, has transformed Gentherm from one of the best companies in the area to work for to one of the worst. When I started, the company was diversifying and expanding, as the CEO and top executives saw the peril of being reliant on one industry, especially one as cyclical as automotive. The new hire training program was one of the best I'd ever experienced, and the team was supportive and helpful. The company was losing money in the short term due to its long-term investments, which apparently spooked Wall Street after a few such quarters.

Since Phil Eyler started, there have been the highly demoralizing constant threats of layoffs and pay and benefit cuts. Within 3 months of his arrival, there was a round of layoffs that cut 10% of the headquarters (engineering, program management, sales, etc.), mostly those with experience (and therefore the highest pay), but not management, of course. Top level executives not on board with the new direction quit within a year and were replaced by yes-men from Eyler's former team at Harman. When COVID started, we all took a 20% ""pay deferral"" due to the plant shutdowns, which we were willing to do since it was to avoid layoffs. In the fall of 2020, the financials were sound enough to restore full salaries and back pay... And a month later, surprise layoffs! More followed in the spring of 2021. Again, it was the experienced employees that got the axe.

Given these changes, culture has shifted from collaborative to competitive, with those best at sucking up and covering for themselves remaining, while those with years of experience get to train their newly graduated replacements and then be shown the door. The numbers look great in the short term, but this isn't the way to foster innovation (one of the company's taglines). Revenue is increasing thanks to price cuts leading to new business, but this trend will reverse once the products are no longer competitive.

Meanwhile, much ink is spilled to the press about the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion, while really it's just for show - there's no diversity (not least of which is diversity of opinions) at the executive level. Foster a nurturing and supportive culture, and the diversity will follow organically without the dog and pony shows. The actual women on our team mostly thought the Gentherm ""Women's Network"" was a joke.

I can't recommend anyone work here until the CEO and his entire cabinet are replaced. I shudder to think what the culture where he came from must have been to have made him this way."

While it varies from clinic to clinic, it often feels like a ""big family"" type of environment with good people rallied around the same mission. Carlos' (YVFWC's CEO) is passionate about the community and is willing to take calculated risks to be the best in healthcare. The company is committed to actually providing good care and not just checking the boxes.","Because the company is so mission focused and the federal funding can fluctuate, YVFWC relies on high productivity from their medical providers. Sometimes this causes burnout and frustration and causes a divide between clinical and administrative employees. That said, the providers are given adequate resources such as dietitians, behavioral health providers, and community health workers so they are not isolated in caring for their patients. These resources help shoulder the burden for the providers even though the volumes expectations may be high."

Doing work smart could not be the reason to get promoted, but if you know the rule of the game, you will probably win. Example: when everybody looks like idiot in the meeting, and someone is doing the job incorrectly, the best idea is shut your mouth up, and act as an idiot as everyone else, otherwise , you will be ""let go"" soon. whenever anythings up, the first thing you should do is cover your own a**!

If you want to stay there in the rest of your life, you should either work hard as a DOG without no respect, or you work as an a**hole to get in good relationship with those big a**holes by ALL MEANS, this is the rule of the game at there forever.

937,1,Absolutely 100% avoid Remington College,"In my six months there, the best day I had was serving hot dogs to students as a morale booster. Everything else was awful.","I’ve been working near constantly since I was 16. About 20 years. I’ve had a few jobs that I wouldn’t choose to go back to, but most were good. The one job you couldn’t offer me enough money in the world to return to is Career Services at Remington. I’ve never woken up sick to my stomach in the morning for any other job. The president walked in every morning to look me over and see what I was wearing - always professional, always the right length, always appropriate. But every morning, I was given the once over. So was my team. The phones are bugged; meetings are listened in on. Reviews with the regional president are nightmarish. He tells you how to prepare then does the opposite of what he says he will do. He sat in the back of a dark room and degraded my team, my progress, everything I did while I had to look ahead and was advised not to turn around to speak to him. I was told what colors to wear on those review days. I was told not to wear lotion or perfume or too much jewelry because it “offended him”. While being spoken to like an idiot, I was told to just sit there and listen and never talk back. What kind of workplace is that? As for the work scope - it’s impossible. If 100 kids graduate, you’re expected to place 100 kids in jobs. If you place 99, they ask why you didn’t place 100. The problem was places wouldn’t hire Remington students because the education they get isn’t good enough to get them hired. While cold calling to try and place students in jobs, employers would ask what school I was calling from. When I told them Remington, sometimes they would say “we don’t hire Remington students”. Sometimes they would just hang up. If the regional career services director is feeling pressured enough, they’ll tell you to fudge the numbers - and they’re ALWAYS feeling pressured. Remington is an awful diploma mill and every location should be forced to shut its doors. Please avoid it. You won’t last long anyway - they don’t keep anyone long. When they do let you go, they’ll make you sign a document that states that nothing unethical is happening at Remington and that you never witnesses anything that could be deemed unethical. Trust me, though, you will. Every day."

Just to lose money on said programme as it didn’t make any sense then ignored employees when they requested for the bonus for the hard work promoting as they were promised. Just radio silence. Things like that happened all the time as well as lone working being the normal practice. Only one poor staff member on minimum wage on desk. No support especially with angry guests and managers were on call 24/7 and were pretty much harassed. Any wonder? Turnover in staff says enough. Treat staff like garbage.

But they also don’t communicate with teams so multiple teams are likely working on similar things. There’s been 4 reorgs in 6 months. Management continues to say we aren’t doing layoffs and shortly after there’s layoffs. In a company meeting to explain the last layoffs. The C Level told everyone this is how this company works, if you don’t like it … leave. There’s no job security in life so we aren’t going to try and rebuild the trust we lost by lying and laying folks off. (Clearly great leadership) Everything is constantly breaking because the company literally doesn’t care at all about quality. Their version of “quality” is a slack channel where the CEO talks about if buttons are 1 or 2 pixels off. So everyone is fighting fires constantly. The tech is horribly outdated, and they do nothing to improve it because we have “features” that are more important. Directors and above do not care about engineers or managers. There is blatant favoritism, and the only way to move up. The CTO wants people to quit as a goal, to “make sure some roles are hard enough”. While the company constantly signs flashy new deals. The outlook for SeatGeek is very very poor, they won’t say it but everyone can see the writing on the wall. There is zero learning and development, culture is horrible. Everyone is over worked. Their version of culture is acting like frat boys and getting drunk after work every day. I could write for days on everything horrible with this company but what’s the point. Just don’t join this company. If you value yourself, have values or want any work life balance. Run. Run away.

3) Employees may be asked to leave immediately without any pay towards 3 months' notice and without any severance package,  just because someone else is seen as God to help the company, no matter how the executive team and leadership would have praised you in the past. This can happen irrespective of your performance, or employment level if you question the CEO on his wrongdoings, and practices who thinks it is his family business. They don't have a place for Ethics but just ego and slavery treatment.
5) One of the newly hired executives, the co-founder also had to leave the company after bearing these immoral practices for years. You can hear numerous examples just by talking to the employees. Don't believe in wrong postings which are paid.

7) Employment terms and conditions are all in favor of the company. No respect for the employees or the labor laws"
600,3,You can do better.,Dogs in the office + free food on Fridays,"What you’ll notice in most of these reviews is that they love the people they work with. And that’s true, people (who are not leadership) are incredibly kind, hard working people. You will find someone who has their own personality and you never have to worry about being yourself. And that definitely makes it a nice place to work. But people and the actual company/work, are two different things. 

People aside, there isn’t much about MT that makes it competitive to the job market. The overall consensus is ‘It’s not bad” from people who came from much worse jobs. Seems to be MT’s bread and butter-- getting people who are extremely unhappy with their current job and use their values as a smoke and mirror to lure new employees in. And that could absolutely be what you need. However, if you know your worth, you’ll quickly learn that you’re underpaid, overworked, and have no growth. 

This is particularly prevalent in less regarded departments where growth is not only non-existent, but it’s common to hold a carrot in front of you with the promise of growth without any actual plan on how that path to growth would be achieved. Do the extra work first, and MAYBE we’ll start eventually talking about where you can go from your job position...even though your responsibilities have already changed and you’ve exceeded these expectations. 

People are underpaid. It’s a well known thing (again, outside of sales) once people realize the work that they do for the amount they receive. You’ll also learn quickly which positions MT values and which ones they deem replaceable.  It's very easy to just take a look at the market of the same event management/project management jobs within either the industry or outside with similar job descriptions and see very quickly that these jobs have a 10-15k+ higher pay. 

Leaderships, is well, very inexperienced, and that can be concerning. They are generally unapproachable, have a cold demeanor, and avoid conversations from most people. Leadership is either unaware of the issues that employees are experiencing, such as capacity, or blissfully ignorant and unwilling to actually make change. Having such leaders with a limited scope of experience doesn't help anyone. 

Final Thought: Only rewarding Sales, having incompetent leadership, and having a company boast about their values without actually delivering is not uncommon, nor is it unique to MT. That is common practice and that’s never going to change. They do not live up to their values, nor do they grasp that they are not competitive in a job market. In a recession market, maybe. In a thriving economy, they are subpar. Only advice is to treat this job as a transition, or acknowledge that there is little growth for you, which you may like. Set limits with yourself and your manager to not be overworked nor have them take advantage of your skill set for the same pay. Be smart and be strategic, because they aren’t."

811,5,Cool Place - Cool people - Growing Fast - Lots You Can Learn,"I worked as an Engineer at Everlywell for more than 3.5 years and overall I have really enjoyed my time there. I've been able to see the company truly grow over that period and one of the coolest things that I can say about the company is how transparent it has always been. Through that transparency, whether it be company all-hands meetings, reports, or general announcements in communications, you are highly exposed to how the business as a whole operates, the relevant KPIs and metrics across departments, and the key strategies to consistently achieve super aggressive goals. Seeing all of these things, at that level detail, get planned, executed, and reported on a regular basis is really educational regardless of what department you are even working in. 

From what I have experienced, having this level of understanding of the business allows teams to practice a much higher degree of autonomy when it comes to delivering work. Teams know what data is relevant to delivering success and are then encouraged to figure out how to best achieve that...directives for features are not really just given to you from the top-down, it's very much driven by the team and makes it much more rewarding and interesting. Teams are also free to use whatever methodology they see appropriate for how they work. If it doesn’t work for your team, you have the power to change it with your team and that's pretty cool.

Not everything has been a smooth ride though, there have been a few bumps along the road, but bumps are unavoidable and I will say that every step of the way, they are asking you ""What can we do better? What's working? What isn't working"" and then they actually take action on the results of those answers. People will listen and there are many ways to have your voice heard in this organization: anonymous + public Q&amp;A, 1+1's, surveys, polls. There is a lot of input to give if you have it. 

The tech stack is modern and pretty fun to work with. There is an effective CI/CD pipeline that generally makes deploys and preview environments very simple…makes the process of working on a ticket, spinning up a preview environment, QA’ing, and then deploying to production super easy. They use/implement feature flags, AB testing, a Design Language System, interaction metrics, automated testing, observability, and real user monitoring. Lots of opportunities to get hands-on experience with many relevant technologies and paradigms. 

I think Everlywell tries hard to keep you engaged with the organization and with the team, especially throughout the pandemic. Between the DEI ERG and the Product + Engineering Culture Committee, there are a lot of valuable activities and programming to take in, if you want to attend. I also appreciate that the company does not ignore the events of the world and acknowledges insane things that are happening. It's nice to be able to feel like a bunch of humans together. Even while being fully remote, I feel like I was able to stay engaged and feel like part of a team, in a non-corny or annoying type of way.

Overall, Everlywell is a great place to be if you want to work with really cool people, learn a lot, and have opportunities to make a big impact.

Other Pros:
* Unlimited PTO (never had an issue getting time off)
* company match for charitable donations
* free tests
* educational stipend
* full time remote","There can be a lot of meetings, but you are also encouraged (by the CEO) to decline meetings that have no agenda. 

There is a big emphasis on OKR’s and goal setting, which is a Pro and helpful from the perspective of career growth within the company, but it also makes for quite a bit of extra administration work. It can be hard to make time to focus on those things sometimes. 

From my experience at Everlywell, it has always been a bit challenging to minimize context switching. Things move fast and it feels like you do get pulled in a few different directions from time to time. This can make it hard to focus sometimes. 

It is always heavily encouraged to attend meetings with your camera on...that can be bleh at times depending on what type of person you are, but isn't really a huge deal.

Teams tend to change frequently (or have in the past), so it can be challenging to get past the forming stage of a team to the point where you really hit your stride and become predictable...which can be frustrating. This is kind of just a symptom of fast growth though...new teams need to come from somewhere I suppose. 

There is a lot going on and can feel a bit overwhelming to keep up with at times - There is a lot of interesting work happening so it can definitely feel like a balancing act...but I feel like I have seen this skewing in a more focused direction between teams over the last year(s) which has been cool to see. 

I feel like most of my cons are probably common to any company at this stage though. It's hard to grow and deal with changes...I think Everlywell stands out in how they really try to make these unavoidable speed bumps as smooth as possible."
245,2,Good money…. No family life,Paycheck and benefits were incredible,Starting at 9 am and getting hone between 8 and 11 every night does not allow for and schedule or family life
823,4,Sales executive,Team chemistry with ability to use my own personal ethical sales tactics and a very kind professional work environment.  Making people smile simply by maintaining a positive attitude.,In order to move up unethical practices by misleading customers would essential be required to  compete with the top reps.   Unfortunately this was frowned upon but overlooked.   Constantly changing industry.   Sales tactics were changed and customer service was no longer priority but instead push selling was required.
322,3,My 1Path Experience,"1Path is a good place to work if you need experience and you need it quick. You will be tossed into the deep end of the pool and you will learn how to administer lots of systems very quickly. 
This is good because even though you may not know everything, you will have lots of assistance from senior positions. 
The company was also able to pay for my certificates, testing material, and any studying courses that I needed. Overall, it was a good place to work at until a certain period.","The company is cheap - plain and simple. Every year, our insurance would go up but our benefits would go down.

The next thing to talk about is promotions and salaries. These were poorly handled as well. During Covid, promotions were completely frozen and so were any merits or bonuses. We were urged that ""cash is king"" but at the same time we got our client base increased with very huge clients and new people were being hired. It doesn't matter if you are a top tier worker or the lowest tier, the company sticks to a 10% rule when giving you a promotion. It doesn't matter if you literally gave the company your life, covered on call shifts, or handled multiple projects - 10% was the max you would get. 

The expectations. If you did your work and showed effort, work would get piled on you. You would get selected in a private chat or a private group to do work before anyone else because you did a great job - until you get burnt out while the people that had lower numbers are twiddling their thumbs. There was even a case where one of the managers berated me for not taking on his project but when I informed him/her how much I had on my plate I was told to ""take it easy and that it was just a joke."""
644,1,This place sucks.,Nice building. Free food. Met some nice people.,Leadership is awful. They all want to be like Dave Ramsey.
159,2,Started off great and then went downhill.,"The flexible schedule is the best thing about this job. You can clock in and out as many times as you want, as long as you complete your hours. You encounter amazing customers who you're really excited to style and get to know along the way. The job is fairly easy and fun to do. If you like shopping, then it's enjoyable!","This company is like a roller coaster and offers zero stability. Inventory is lacking at all times, is constantly depleted and whoever is in charge of merch just cannot get it together. The same problems have been occurring consistently over the last few years with no changes being made. Hours are not guaranteed so if they're slow, they cut your hours and this is common during the holidays when you need money the most. They state they're about transparency but I really felt like a lot was hidden and not disclosed to employees. They welcome feedback but never put any of it into play. All of this in turn affects the customers and they are not given the best experience they could get. Covid was blamed for a lot of inventory issues however, other plus size boutiques never had problems maintaining a nice selection so this just didn't make sense. Raises were not given for a solid two years until a large majority of stylists quit. They offer performance based bonuses but because of cut hours, it just barely brought your paycheck back up to what it usually was, so it really did not feel like a bonus at all. The higher ups who have seemed the most qualified and capable have left and jumped ship which is very concerning. They are very concerned with public image and preach diversity and inclusion so employees that are chosen for public campaigns and projects are not necessarily picked based on merit, but on skin color. The D&amp;I at Dia doesn't include every ethnicity, body type, gender, religion, education/experience."
978,1,Disrespectful,There are no Pros-- STEER CLEAR.,"Company that see's people in recovery as dollar signs- does nothing to give back to the SUD community. Multiple layoffs throughout the years proves leadership does not care about employees. Employees who were employed for years are either laid off, bullied out, or leave out of frustration because they are not being listened to."
430,1,"Inhumane, Painful and humiliating","Wonderful and friendly team members, some great talent.","Worst leadership ever. Micromanagement at its best. Leadership is clueless and have zero business sense. 

Work place bullying is common from senior leadership. I have seen colleagues crying and I cried myself coz of bad treatment. 

All departments work crazy hours. Most of times its not even client demanding unrealistic deadlines but management trying to please client when there is no need. Probably companies greed to make more money by not paying for all the extra hours employees put in. Situation is so bad that, couple of times employee(s) have had mental breakdown and  had to take sick off to recover. Far worse conditions for US team.  Common for US team to work past midnight.

By adding a line in contract that says "" your salary covers for all time required to complete your job"" company thinks they can make people work like slaves. 

Company introduced unlimited leave policy to fool around and lure talent. The ground reality is people do not have time to take even standard  4 weeks of annual leave. And this has nothing to do with Covid times. Company had to force employee to take long weekends to get things right in the books as many had as many as 3 months of accumulated outstanding A/L . So if you are tempted with unlimited leave policy its just a hoax. No one have ever managed to enjoy this perk.

People move as soon as they see an opportunity. Do not believe me, please check Linkedin Page for yourself how many team members jumped boat in last 2-2.5 years. 

If you are seeking a role at TimeZoneOne do your research and think twice before applying or accepting the offer. Stay away, unless you desperately need a job, and this is your last and only option."

A whole 50% of the team doesn’t get that experience. 
• no work/life balance. At one point I was clocking 250 hours a month
• nobody here is able to really and genuinely help individuals grow towards career goals
• the favorites game is absolutely ridiculous. There’s a small circle of people beloved by the Founder that can do no wrong, even after serious complaints about bullying and lack of work…you’ll still see them getting promotions
• Harassment isn’t handled well here. There were several employees complained about constantly and every time it was reported HR/leadership acted like they had never heard of this issues before. So, either they don’t communicate or they don’t care. But don’t worry, those abusive people got nice promotions. 
• feedback is nonexistent. 
• Founder is frequently inappropriate, making moves on employees at social events, drunk dialing in the middle of the night to scream at your or cry at you, just really unstable.
• DEI work is honestly run by a really wonderful person who has built a committed team, but leadership does almost nothing to pull that into actual day to day work and instead uses it as a flashy award submission."

495,1,A good way to get your foot in the door to the IT Field.,"Experience gain is pretty much the only pro I could mention here. You could start from nothing in terms of an IT skillset and they'll get you up to speed. If a diverse working environment is your thing, then you can also get that here.","Where to begin. Management is not forward thinking. Being in the middle of a recession, working on top dollar computers be they desktop or laptop for a starting 15 an hour is almost criminal for a technical job that requires an attention to detail at production speed. Not to mention the work is back breaking, and depending on which department you get, your colleagues could be less than professional. On that subject, the amount of workplace animosity that flies around is horrendous, it doesn't help that the quotas that are set, provide the perfect breeding ground for a toxic working environment. Communications to the upper echelon is slow, any request you might want to make, any change you need to work better barring anything medical is usually shot down. You will be standing at all times, because the company subscribes to the idea of standing = better production. The training, if you can even call it that, is non-existent, and the procedure by which you work is ever fluctuating. And, the best thing of all, while you endure the day, best hope you don't have a configuration set wrong, or a clip on the back of a laptop isn't properly set. Tiny things like that, which could be easily fixed by the Quality Assurance technician in each department, will result in an NCI or Non-Compliance Issue.
But I think the most glaring issue of all was the promise of bonuses for harder work, great, awesome, there's the incentive I've been looking for, who doesn't like more money. Three MONTHS after we were supposed to get them they started actually cobbling together the metric for which bonuses should have been awarded."

For some reason, leadership can't get out of the old, toxic patterns many startups have like grind culture and ""we're all a family here"" attitudes. This company demands everything quickly and doesn't care care sustainability. - The company culture is poor. When I started, it was healthier. Now it's large workloads with little recognition. Very much an attitude of ""keep grinding and don't stop."" I wish they celebrated wins. - I grew to very much dislike the upper leadership, mainly COO and CEO. We were told that we were the experts on our projects, but then they'd tell you exactly how to do everything and give you unachievable goals. Very quick to speak and slow to listen. Leadership wants to have every department under their thumb and under complete control that they aren't willing to admit they don't have all of the answers. They should rely on the experience of those actually doing the day-to-day work, not just their own opinions. - Their business outlook is terrible. Everything is on a month-to-month basis. Leadership could tell you to focus all your time on one project for a month then scrap it the next. If they don't see success within a few weeks, they consider the initiative a failure. Definitely not how business projects work. Leadership is so focused on succeeding quickly that they don't care to give you the time or the resources to properly do your job. - From my experience/outlook, leadership is sexist when it comes to promotions. During my time there, at least two male colleagues received promotions while female workers (who had been there longer/were doing just as well) never advanced even though there was the room for their advancement. I don't think leadership feels like they have a preference towards men, but that's exactly what a blind bias is. They need to reconsider how they value their employees. - You will be expected to work without the proper tools. Anything outside of the meager platforms they already have is outside of the question. They aren't willing to invest in the proper tools for you to do your job. Very much a ""use what you have"" attitude, but their expectations and goals far outshine what can be done with what they gave us."
