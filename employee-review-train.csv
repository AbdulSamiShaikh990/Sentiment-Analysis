558,3,"Great place to kick start your career, but leave it before it chews  you up","One of the few places where you are promoted based on potential not necessarily on actual achievements, which is a pro when you want to grow fast, but also a con since you inevitably end up working with a bunch of sweet talkers that are good in showing off without getting anything done. The company teaches you a lot though and let’s you take on a lot of responsibility early on, which if you’re up for it it’s an incredible learning opportunity. The culture is very direct and decisive and I have always considered it to be a very strong side.","Where do I begin... toxic management especially in the last 2-3 years, leaders in Mancom backstabbing each other to bring good news first, because it’s bringing the news that counts not delivering results. People with zero empathy leading the People function. Company is really struggling to reinvent organic growth, so targets are being achieved through constant cost cuts which are putting enormous pressure on already lean structure and people, pushing many into burnout. If you stay in role for too long something must be wrong with you, so many people like these are labeled “blockers”. Diversity and inclusion is window dressing since the real career opportunities go mostly to Brazilian males and you can be awesome but if you’re not part of this club “you can’t sit with us”. Pay is below market average since you’re supposed to get good bonuses, but as the company struggles with results there’s been no bonus since 2019, shares are down and digging so you do the math. Super short term oriented which is sad for a company of this size."

597,3,Lacking in proper training.,I loved being a property manager. Pay was under what should have been for the size apartments and responsibilities I had. Benefits were okay.,"Training was left to another property manager who was on a power trip and took another property to manage. The first week or so was good but then there wasn't much time to properly train me on the many, many reports required. I asked the regional when she came to please help me but most of her time was spent on the phone or her laptop. The properties were being renovated and they expected you to add being over all that plus your other job duties. 8 hrs in a day was never enough! Why they didn't have a project manager over all this I will never know. Leases were expired and everytime I ask for help I was told there were more important things to do. HAP payments weren't posted because I was never shown how. Ledgers were messed up horribly. I kept telling them I need help! Was told not to tell the owners all the problems going on at the property. Basically to lie to them. When people skipped out instead of moving them out I was told to leave it as if they were just behind on the rent, that way vacancies would not be up. I could go on and on. The regional came in out of the blue and fired me for being overwhelmed. No warning, no write up, no verbal. Just your fired. Would I advise this company...NO! Look at their management turnover. They put more emphasis on their regionals than the backbone of the company. The property managers. I had 10 years experience and have worked at much larger properties. Not to mention the morals of their so called Christian regional that all she wanted to talk about when she took us out to lunch was having to drink before she had sex with her husband. Is this the best you can do Beztak?"
166,1,Most  degrading company I ever worked for,There are no pros to working for this company.,"I don't even know where to begin. The pay is awful, there are no benefits, the owners and upper management are vile and the environment is toxic. This is the worst place I have ever worked for. Upper management goes out of their way to put you down. They take any opportunity to speak to you condescendingly. I have never felt more disrespected at work. I have worked for a large corporate company since leaving club tattoo and I can say, they violate so many laws and basic practices. I do not suggest anyone to work here. The owners act like they are a Fortune 500 company when all they are is a strip mall tattoo shop."

Even though I didn't have an issue on going to the bench, I found it extremely difficult to get the project experience I wanted due to my location. Even when I found a project, my own region blocked me from going."
66,5,Great Company Who Cares About Employees,Very positive company culture and support from all levels,Employment was based on passing the series 6 in a short amount of time. I was unaware at the time of hire my employment was contingent upon passing the test the first attempt and that I would be terminated immediately. I happened to be among the first round of employees they were terminating upon failure of series 6 on first attempt. Prior to me if an employee failed they were given another chance. I will say my branch manager was such a huge support and fought to see if there was anything that could be done.
142,4,You have to work to get the rewards,"LOTS of opportunity if you are willing to work hard and be humble. A company this big always has a place for the right fit person. It also has an endless opportunity to learn how things work in the financial services industry, if you are flexible, willing to move laterally, and in some cases, geographically.","Generally pays middle-of-the-market and due to the economic downturn, doesn't bonus to meet/beat the market, as in past. Also, there are still a number of VERY difficult personalities and politics (as there would be anywhere), and some of them advance up and fast, so you have to be willing to tolerate that. Sometimes, finding the right management fit, which can make a vast amount of difference, can be difficult. You can make more and move higher by leaving and coming back. Lastly, you have to have a level of tolerance for the uncertainty of the market."

828,4,Good if you drink the cool aid.,"When management is good they are excellent. They moved mountains to allow me to take parental leave when it was important for me to do so. There is a great deal of pride in the company from Apple employees, which is justified. Having the brand on ones resume is surprisingly influential. The employee discount is very generous. Some of the customer interactions are very fulfilling on a human level. It is relatively easy to transfer stores, even internationally.","There is a great deal of competition between staff members and it is usually the ones who evangelise the brand most who come out on top, regardless of performance. More than once I was passed over for promotions or other rewards such as trips to Cupertino and additional training opportunities, despite consistently being one of the stores top performers (contrary to popular belief, Apple Store employees do have targets). This is one of the reasons I left; management did not want to take me out of my sales position (known internally as 'the Red Zone') where I was a solid performer and allow me to stretch my wings. I was only the second person in the stores history to receive the maximum possible ranking in my annual review. Subsequently I saw many junior staff members whom I tried move ahead given opportunities I missed out on which eventually made me feel disillusioned."

332,1,Terrible Unscrupulous Business Practices,Work from home(but that is Covid related),"Benefits are extremely expensive, dont want to pay their employees what their worth, horrible management, no working with employees if management has issues with them - just fire them or demote without any warning. Management is extremely fake. Unrealistic expectations for the amount of pay. Won't pay you over time."
665,1,Company with the worst employee handling attitude.,"No pros for this company. Joining this company itself is worst experience of mine.

Behaviour with employees in a pathetic way is something this company teach

Best in providing fake reviews

Favouritism with employees leading to the worst team management","Worst manager.
Management is poor in managing team and also poor in providing increments

Asking for bonds if need increments

Worst experience of HR and policies

250,3,"Growth at the beginning, then toxic and stressful afterwards","-During school year, you will have mornings and Fridays off so you can run errands. 
-It feels rewarding when students and families see the result of your efforts and trust that you will achieve their academic needs and goals. 
-Most teachers are dedicated and friendly. 
-You are in charge of your own center with your business style (as long as you make the sales). 
-You will learn a lot of how to run the business. It is a great opportunity in your resume if you want to grow in the education field.","-Work on Saturdays. 
-Extreme pressure under the management when you fall behind the sale target, so the District Manager will micro-manage you. They will ask you to work above and beyond the job scope because you are salary paid. 
- They ask you to meet the sale while well managing current students' academic progress. Too many plates for one person. 
-Since the new CEO comes, they spend millions of dollars in new software: Microsoft workspace, Salesforces, Docusign. I don't even know if the implementation are necessary or they should use this money to other areas. They give you the new laptop but tell you it is not connected to the printer so you still need the old laptop for printing :O
-High turnover rate of education coordinators, because they are demanded to do so much work while under paid. There is no room for career growth if the center director stays for years."
908,4,"360i was great, DAN not so much","Unlimited PTO, Summer Fridays, 1 week of Holiday Break, generous holiday calendar, several office events, insurance, TicketsAtWork, 401K with match, pre-tax metrocard, adoption and fertility assistance, fun clients, free alcohol, rooftop.

The coworkers are very cool and there are several notable clients. Folks were very open to talk about my career plans and letting me sit in on meetings to figure out what I’m interested in. Office events were fun and not too forced. Leadership was very respectful in my experience. Room for upward growth, but not as flexible with switching departments.","Halfway through my time there, our team got switched over to dentsu instead of 360i. That stripped us of our unlimited PTO and Summer Fridays, which was a real bummer. It seemed like we always had different rules because of this. Because I was on the Office Hospitality team, I often felt like an outsider looking in. We were treated with respect mostly, but never really felt like a part of the team. Due to COVID, I was furloughed for 8 months then eventually let go. Tried applying to entry-level positions/apprenticeships so I could stay with the company and grow in my career. They put on a front about wanting to help me but never really did anything about it, even though I was very passionate about the company, its clients, and culture. Wish it didn’t end on a sour note, but I still see the company in a positive light."

735,1,Literally terrible,"Benefits, competitive wage, some nice people","Literally terrible work environment. 5 sick days for the whole year and then every time you get sick after that you must provide a note or you'll get a write up. Your stats/bonus all depend on your sales. Despite working in loyalty/customer care. They also track how many times someone calls back within 1 week of speaking to you. If they do, it will impact you negatively. Of course you can see into the future and solve issues before they happen! It will also impact you negatively if someone cancels within 60 days of speaking with you. And of course, if you have to cancel someone too. They only want you to sell phones. They will put you on a ""performance plan"" you have to meet if you are not hitting your stats, or be terminated. Even though the stats are only supposed to ""encourage"" you to get additional bonus pay. It's for them. Not you. This prompts other agents to feel pressure to sell plans and has agents lying through their teeth about phones they're sending to clients/plans they are being given which results in later escalations and call backs... usually once it's too late. Just horrible."

Stable job environment. Retention is fairly high and there are a lot of seasoned coworkers.

Company is stable and many product areas to try.

An obvious one, but the status that comes from working for an iconic company.","Not as much room for promotion or growth (at least on the team I was on). People were very competitive, but the vibe was that management expected people to work with both ends of the candle burning as the norm.

While there are many product areas, my impression is that exploring other teams and trying to transfer to another is strongly discouraged. Transfering to a different division is even more of a challenge.

Not much support by management to explore areas of interest in terms of new tools or technologies. This might have been a culture trait of my team.

Lots of redundant menial work that should be automated, but no bandwidth given to work on tools for these. Also a lot of the existing tools were slow or error prone and needed to be improved or redone, but again no bandwidth given for these.

Not great at onboarding new employees in my team (I am not referring to the general NEO done by HR). Lack of training materials and outreach to integrate new FTEs."

They never credit the salary on time in the history of this company not even a single time, moreover sometimes they do not even credit the salary and they do once in 2 months or once in 1.5 month. 
2. They have never credited performance linked amount inspite of fullfiling there criterion(once you complete 5 years) and no one ever got there plp amount till now. 

3. They have all information present in website or other sites are false and there are less than 20 employees overall and only 2 offices in total which they claim  in Singapore and delhi but there are no offices there. 
 4. Previous experience they show are all fake as there employees uses top company brand name to show they have worked there in past. 

5. They are not management consultants and they don't have any project ongoing or any client they make fool to new joiners as say they will give training but sadly they themselves need to attend some training as they know nothing about business. 

6. Almost everyone left from the company and those who are there always talks about running out once there salaries of previous months which was on hold for long time will get credited. 

7. They post fake job openings just to look cool in social media.

78,1,Does Not Honor their Mission statement and Values,There is not one 'Pro' at this company,"No Communication, so you can't do your job efficiently and correctly. No training. Gossip and extremely unprofessional Sr. leaders who lack much needed knowledge of managing an organization. Discrimination and you feel like you're walking on egg shells all the time. very heartless management with one-sided views who aren't open to others thoughts or suggestions. No empowerment; no room for growth; low team morale across the board, whether it's in the clinics or their corporate headquarters. Worse place I've worked in my whole life. Horrible work environment and thick air 24/7. If you want to feel undervalued and not appreciated for your dedication and hard work, :(, work here."
85,1,Very toxic company,"There are some pretty talented people there, but the only ones that last are the ones who are either yes people, or the ones who somehow happen to agree with management...","Very toxic culture, crazy high turnover, big whale customers clearly steer the ship, very unlikely it will ever manage to turn a profit due to insane overhead. You can give you're all to the company, generally over-extending yourself, but the minute you disagree and push back, you're gone with zero warning. Promises are made to investors without factoring in the reality of how that will harm the employees and then employees are expected to make up for the inadequacies of management. The business chases whales instead of thoughtful business practices. Their business is too heavily reliant on service providers that make the concept of them ever actually growing from a startup to a mature company completely implausible. They've been around for 10 years and still consider themselves a startup and use that to make excuses for lack of vision and guidance. Buyer beware."

83,3,The company is stagnant.,Casual dress. General sense of friendliness at the office.,"The longer you work at Kipsu, the more you realize that the company is spinning its wheels. Yes, Kipsu was impacted by COVID-19 more than other software companies (being entrenched in the hospitality industry) but even despite that, before the pandemic and through the recovery, you can see that Kipsu is just sputtering along. The product barely ever changes. Sales goals are often not met. Bugs are rarely resolved. Customers request things that rarely ever get followed through on. As a whole the company is way too frugal and tries to DIY everything, which makes the employees feel strapped and overworked."
992,1,Most Toxic Culture Ever,"Opportunity for growth, work location is very versatile","Expensive benefits, pay is low-balled if you don’t negotiate, micromanagement is exercised from the top down, hyper-inflated egos of certain leaders, inconsiderate boss who is far from impartial and less than fair, laughable reps and practices, no sense of TEAM, different management attention and treatment for different associates, non-involved execs, supervisors will ignore you in petty fashion for giving notice to resign then harass you after you leave the company. Upper management is routinely dishonest with clients (and will do everything to stop you from exposing it)."
790,1,Fundamentally broken due to poor management,"To be fair, benefits were good, there were quite a few company parties through the years and there were short massages each week for those who wanted them","Where to start? The family who owns this company are a group of manipulative, selfish people who look down on others and have a silver spoon in their mouths. At first I was excited about my career here, though quickly came to realize that vertical movement was entirely dependent on how much you could suck up to the bosses, how loud you were, and how much you would let work intrude on your personal life. I've seen people describe this place as an ""environment for self starters"" and ""not for those who are lazy"" but that's just another way of saying they will use and abuse those who put up with it, and those who want to be treated with respect are fired. I saw dozens of people go through the company like a revolving door. The owner refuses to censor himself and would make lewd remarks on a daily basis to the point HR had to follow him around. He'd make a show of having employees of minority groups for his own optics at company parties and on calls, while also forgetting their names on regular weekdays. I know for a fact that the female employees who I worked with made 20% less than I did as a new hire. Many of their senior employees openly admitted to me that they were racist and/or sexist, patting me on the back for that previous fact that I was making more than my female Indian coworkers and saying there's nothing wrong with it. Management was aware of this and turned a blind eye to it. In addition there were a handful of scandals through the years of their favorite employees needing to be bailed out of jail, and the owners would personally step in to sweep it under the rug. As mentioned in other negative reviews, there is an environment of ""you can do it if you put in the effort"" initially but in reality it turns into a setting of passive-aggressive tension at all times, with axes hanging over peoples heads every month."

399,5,"Fantastic Company, Amazing People","I worked for Fahlgren Mortine for about 1.5 years and it was an exceptional experience. There are many talented people that I was able to work alongside and learn from. Management is open to receiving feedback, supportive and creative. The teams approach new projects with fresh ideas, making it exciting to be involved and in turn, being proud to be a part of the team. There are many opportunities to get to know other team members (across a large company) because they are sure to do monthly activities - and did a great job boosting company morale even during a pandemic!",The structure of the company is very different.

In my experience everyone really did work together and look out for each other. My supervisors were nice, helpful, and genuinely interested in seeing that our days were made less stressful. The pay was fair for the work. My coworkers were really some of the best and made the days a lot more fun .","Unfortunately, there were very limited hours. Even most professors are only given part time hours. It just isn't enough to sustain yourself on, and a lot of my coworkers had second (or third) jobs to try and make ends meet. 

This is also not the place to be if you're looking for advancement opportunities. It's not that it can never happen - I was one of the few that actually WAS promoted to a higher paying position - but it's very rare.

267,3,Covid-19 sucks,Great concept and salary was very competitive with other retailers.,I think that Covid-19 stopped the company from moving forward with plans for the future. However the company was making drastic changes before the pandemic that were very difficult to work through.
358,1,A Mess,You feel cool wearing a Tesla logo,"Working at Tesla was a nightmare; the stress was insurmountable. It was a chaotic, hostile environment. Every quarter they were changing our compensation, or job requirements. A lot of things didn't seem legal as it pertained to how they were changing things. The most incompetent employees were promoted - especially to director. This then had a domino effect on the rest of the employees. Most of the time, no one knew what was going on, and the worst part of it was how the customers were being handled with gross neglect. I'd also like to mention as a female employee, it was very apparent that women were not respected in the workplace, and were not given the same opportunities as their male counterparts. Overall, Tesla seems like a cool company that's trying to change the world, but the reality is it is a giant, chaotic mess. One bad decision after another."
869,2,Dropped staff with no warning when covid hit,"Relaxed environment around the office, friendly coworkers, lower management was making attempts to modernize testing approaches at the time I left (introducing automated testing, making moves towards agile), a few good eggs.","Upper management halted all progress even after hiring progressive lower management, created environment of apathy.

Unlimited leaves, but on ""your managers' approval"", haha n that never goes smooth even if you take less than twenty leaves in a calendar year. 

You get to work with people who gets ""embarrassed"" (quoted word) and go for an escalation when you point out that they are coming up with contradicting requirements in a planning meeting.

Best culture for a remote-first company. ""People not only lack empathy to reply to slack, but they also don't have email or meeting etiquette"". 

5% is a very decent hike (So, if you think you did your salary negotiations well... haha).

There is no trust between the US engineering team and the India engineering team, so it's you don't have to do ""much"" if you are in India.

Congratulations for making till here among all the fake/paid reviews. You should be able to figure out that this review is true if you pay a little attention during your interview.

3. No good work culture. 
4. Lot of politics. Especially senior people, they put a blame on you for every mistake. 
5. Hiring process too slow . All senior HR's are so irresponsible that it's difficult to work as a team with them becoz they will try to dominate &amp;put a blame of theirs on others."

It's a great place to work for anyone wanting to make an impact and also be part of the tech world.,Must feel comfortable making decisions and having a certain level of autonomy/responsibility.

784,1,Terrible culture at UK Asset Management,Good exposure to different elements of portfolio management,"Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is a contemptuous and obnoxious (in his own words) bully. Culture is shocking with 1980s work practices the norm. Discrimination on both mental health and parental responsibility grounds, with HR being totally inept at protecting the vulnerable. Bullies are protected by the business. Do not work here- it will destroy your mental health. MUFG Asset Management pays well below market standard and there is no upside. A sinking ship."

360,1,Unfortunate Waste of 6 of my Best Career Years,The money was good for the area.,"No matter how hard you work, if you're not one of the ""chosen ones"" you probably will not get the training needed to advance. To me, it seemed corrupt, far too competitive, and strategically controlled to benefit very few carefully chosen individuals. Not for me. Many others were unhappy but wouldn't dare say so for fear of retaliation, despite the ""most ethical company"" reputation they have somehow ""earned."""
450,2,"Get your foot in the door, then GTFO","-They hired me with no experience.

-This company gave me exposure to cybersecurity. I wouldn't have the job I have now if I didn't start here.

-Only company that was fun. Most of the SOC guys and developers arrange breaks to play video games or shoot pool.","-Atrocious pay. Every coworker I knew had roommates, including my first boss who was there for 4 years. Compared to what I'm paid now, it's downright pathetic. Starting out, you make the same hourly pay, or slightly more, than an In-N-Out employee.

-Novacoast might call themselves ""tight-knit"", but it's really just nepotism. When I started there, the majority of people in my department had some type of friendship/relationship with the manager before they were hired.

-If you're not into Reddit-type humor or gaming, you'll feel out of place. Most of the employees are students or recent graduates, because the SOCs are purposely built in college towns so they can farm cheap, naive student labor. 

-Huge employee turnover. I noticed two types: 
a) my first manager quit and all his minions followed
b) Guys who worked there for a month or two and found out it sucks, either because the rest of the guys on his shift don't pull their weight or because they got stuck on night shift where they're the only employee present. Honestly, I can't blame those guys. I worked in the SOC and we would just keep getting new customers piled on us. A very dangerous formula for an undermanned, underpaid staff that needs to be staffed 24/7. But there is always a fresh stream of students looking to break into cyber, and Novacoast knows that, so it's all good in their eyes.

I stayed for 2 years and felt like that was enough. I've scanned all the guys from my department who are in my LinkedIn, and they've all left Novacoast. There is much better money to be had elsewhere. If you land a position in the Kansas or Michigan locations, it might not be so bad because of the cost-of-living."
228,2,Very bad management.,Fellow employees made this employer a bit bearable.,"No raises, very bad management. They would scream and curse at employees. Bad compensation packages, there's no even free tea or coffee. All this happened while the CEO was sitting pretty in his office with not so much as a thought as to how their decisions had impacted the lives of others with no warning. It was absolutely humiliating."
951,1,"This company will ruin your life, health and peace, not just your career.",I doubt there are any points to add here.,"The top managers are swindlers, lead by the most unethical, callous, human you will ever come across. They will make your life a living hell and they do as it pleases them. Right from fooling customers, to employees, to their partners, it is all built over a hollow, deceitful foundation. Pick up any current/ex-employee and discuss the company with them, you will find the same feedback. There is zero respect and value for employees. The CEO will yell all day and the other leaders will wag their tails, only to talk crap behind his back. Your fnf and documents will never be fulfilled. Some day this company will come down so bad because it has crippled a lot of hopeful careers and innocent souls."

-Remote work is only for Senior LOs that are Top Producers- everyone else will be in office and being constantly monitored by the Sales Managers

363,1,Great company for some,The art and creative environment.,The culture can be toxic. Management plays favorites and if you’re on the wrong side of those favorites… good luck. Favoritism has nothing to do with merit. Working harder will not help. They think you should feel so lucky to work there instead of the company feeling lucky to have talented employees. We really learned that everyone is expendable and they don’t actually care about their employees. I should say that I left on my own. I was not let go.

There’s currently a COVID-19 + unit there, and you won’t get paid if you become COVID-19 +. Also, not everyone is getting hazard pay. Does that make sense? There are nurses, CNAs, RTs, dietary, etc., that are constantly in contact with staff that are going into the COVID-19 + units, so why isn’t everyone getting hazard pay? It was definitely soul crushing to see the “Heroes Work Here” signs in the front of the building, when administration isn’t even paying us what we’re worth. That is why I left. There are plenty of other facilities that honor hazard pay. Please don’t even apply here."
429,1,Don't work there.,There are none. Horrible experience.,No concessions for people who want to attend school.
8,1,Regrettable Experience - A Workplace To Be Wary Of,- Eye-opening: Teaches you exactly how a company should not be run. - Pays the bills: The compensation is tolerable. - Diverse clientele: Exposure to a broad range of clients if you can tolerate the cons.,- Communication breakdown: There is an endemic lack of communication that exacerbates every problem within the company. - Soul-crushing work-life balance: Expectation to dedicate your life to the job. Personal time and commitments are disregarded. - Dead-end job: Promises of advancement are smoke and mirrors. Don't expect growth or meaningful recognition. - Toxic culture: Cut-throat environment that fosters hostility and stress. Cooperation and collegiality are non-existent.
156,2,Stuck in the past,"The office is nice, and everyone has a very ""can-do"" attitude. The location is close to the city. Working on a life-saving device is fulfilling.","The device has limited utility and a small customer base; a new version has not been successfully commercialized in a decade or so. The organization is slow-moving and little attention is given to fixing systemic problems. Everything has to be brought before upper management to make a decision, and management politics therefore effectively stall almost all productive change.

Not a fulfilling environment for talented engineers and developers; the org is too bureaucratic and hierarchical to innovate properly, and there is little room to advance. Salaries are not competitive with other tech companies now present in the Pittsburgh area."

If you are an LVT you can and will end up working in all support roles other than the veterinarian. It takes away the focus of managing.

708,3,Pay is good. Management not so much.,The pay is good. You earn an hourly wage as well as commission. The product sells itself most of the time.,Commission can bring out the worst in people.

- no Customer Success function for most customers in region but the one guy in the job gets paid on all of your work
- poor collaboration between teams and many people doing minimal work - if you are in Sales, you have no support. Strong focus on remote distributed workforce so team culture is weak
- there is a lot of people focused on themselves and KPIs without thinking about the customer or company goals

They'll snooker you in with high-falutin' talk about making it a great place to work and being there for their employees.  They'll cater a lunch every month and hold meetings where you can speak up and state your views.  But as time goes on, you'll start to realize that no one is listening.  And those meetings are starting to add up, and they're all supposed to be on green time.  And then you'll program will get cut by the government for no reason, and it'll be adios muchachos."

486,1,I don't recommend it,"- Good pay but so is any other start-up tech company in the US

- I think this company is perfect for fresh college graduates. Stay and learn here for a year or two.","- Employees. CB4 boasts they continually improve the conditions of their employees and that it’s striving to become an employer of the year by winning various awards from places like Inc.com and builtinnyc.com among others. But If you look at LinkedIn data, the medium tenure hasn’t changed since 2009. This means people don’t stay with the company longer, so CB4’s claims of any ‘positive’ changes are not working.

- Customers. Not great advocacy from customers. If you check out their case studies page online, you will notice that majority of the case studies they were able to secure were small, regional convenience stores. By the way, about 5 of these case studies are irrelevant as some of them are no longer CB4’s customers.

- Product. Currently, CB4’s main and only focus is for brick and mortar retailers. Physical retail space is a tough market to be in this digital age. Each year globally more and more people change their buying habits to online as it offers more convenience, safety and saves them time. Many brands leverage rich interactive online experiences that replace those that retail spaces used to offer so there’s less and less incentive to go to the physical store. In my opinion, if CB4 doesn’t rethink its core product offering and re-orient itself to start thinking about shifting global behavior patterns it won’t survive for long.

- Finances. The company doesn’t seem to be financially solid. Any small changes in the market or a loss of a customer almost certainly is going to send a shock wave throughout the entire company. So be ready to navigate in rocky waters if you decide to work there.


Other things worth mentioning:

- Drives image of inclusion and diversity but more of a marketing ploy than a practiced culture. See their leadership page. There are no BIPOC or female VPs as of (April 2021).

- Politics and top-down hierarchy.

- They make people sign vicious and inhuman one-way NDAs and separation agreements. People basically waive any rights to speak up. Don’t be surprised to see so many positive reviews and so little negative ones for that exact reason."
712,2,"Promised opportunity, missed delivery","Fast-paced, casual workplace(if you like this), opportunity to move up job titles if you want to, there are some extremely knowledgeable individuals here to learn from.","Slow career growth, moving up a job title does not equal a pay increase, poor support from upper management in a team lead role, they hire from anywhere and everywhere, no matter background and it made closing loans very difficult, in my time there I saw many consequences of hiring so many unqualified people. The temp agencies they work with also need to do a better job vetting people, I don't blame Nations for the temp agency sending them a lack of talent and collecting a paycheck on it."
134,2,Terrible upper management made work frustrating,"No early hours , could ""check out"" games for product knowledge purposes, employee discount.","toxic upper managment, confusing floor plans, customers expect you to know everything about every game/system, the prices are non negotiable when it comes to trades, so customers get pissed like we just decided how much their worn out controller with drift-stick is worth."
704,1,Recruiter,There is nothing great about this company!,The employees are unfairly paid compared to other staffing companies. Management 100% expects you to love your job  and stay with the company forever.
312,1,Avoid Newsy,"Prior to October 2021, we hired a group of good-hearted people who worked their tails off who owned Election Day 2020 coverage, January 6 and the COVID story with little resources. The people next to you wanted you to do well, and you wanted to them to do well too. Friendly and talented journalists","Since relaunching, Newsy has made problematic hires whether it is people with questionable social media posts or minuscule journalism experience. The company never learned from its mistakes despite relaunching several times of the last five years. Most are overworked, benefits were slimmed down in 2021, anchors are just faces and not leaders and managers don't manage. Internal politics have gotten nastier. Newsy doesn't stand out anymore and it is just trying to be like everyone else...but with purple graphics. The editorial direction has reverted back to the bad habits of traditional journalism, such as ""getting both sides"" and breathless live news coverage. Employees also do not know where they stand with influential managers and get tossed to the side or pigeonholed despite employees pushing back and speaking up.

At least 5 directors were told to apply for the same job they had so they could keep their position during the relaunch. Some reporters were automatically shifted to a new team and didn't have to worry about their jobs while others were told to move to Atlanta with little assistance or guarantees or face termination. Again, this company has made the same mistakes over and over again for years."

Competition between business units and zero interference from VPs of toxic behavior, such as exclusion and elitism, defined the workplace culture - while members with relevant expertise were pushed to the side. Several employees execute tasks covered by multiple roles at other companies and aren't paid market value to do so.

Sixth, Someone needs to inform them that it takes 40 hours to learn their spill, so their need to pain folks for that."
194,1,Not A Company Who values their employees.,"None, the company has not shown any endearing qualities the entire time I was there. Across All roles I worked.","Every employee who is in a production role is only seen as a seat. They do not look out for the wellbeing of their employees unless legally required to, and even then, they cut corners wherever they can. Their driving value is to look out for the bottom line, and they will spend as little as possible and avoid responsibility wherever it lets them save money. They are a predatory employer and will exhaust a workforce and adjust their standards to allow them to make as much money as possible. They do not practice the things which they advertise to their clients unless they have someone on location. If you are not in a production role, then you are held responsible for every situation where someone else drops the ball in process or procedure, taking up the slack and making sure goals are met, regardless of where the lapse occurred. There are no performance incentives, nor appreciation efforts made for support staff. They will run you into the ground and do not care about your mental health at all."

706,1,Avoid this company,Pre-IPO bank based in San Francisco,"1. Varo called themself a fintech but they are nothing but a regional bank, penny-pinching, and slow to move. 
2. Varo claims to have more than 4 million customers but a very small portion of it is daily active. Avg customer account balance is in double-digit and most are $0, Their target customers are unbanked and low income, while its a noble idea to provide financial services to this segment, but there is a good reason why large banks avoid this segment. Its too expensive and doesnt contribute to profit. Unfortunately, people with $0 struggle with daily expenses, and they cannot use bank's profit-making products like lending. Varo will never go profit, it's the VC's money that keeping it afloat far now once that dry's up then it is destined to sink. Varo right now makes revenue through ATM fees, they leech these poor people. So if you are thinking that its the next Chime then it's not. Bay Area has enough fintech startups, this is not the one.
3. Other new banks dont have a bank charter, they invest in company's growth and making great products. Varo claims that bank charter is their strength but its not, they spent more than $125 million of VC money to get this charter and now they are regulated like any other bank which is expensive. I think they should have not got the charter so early. SOFI got the bank charter 12 yrs after getting founded, for the first 10 yrs their focus was user growth.
4. Varo compares itself with SOFI and valued its stock at $7.88 but SOFI is 8 times bigger than Varo and is profitable, SOFI's stock is $6.5 (Aug 2022). Money Lion stock is $1.25 and they are 3 times bigger than Varo, I think Varo is a penny stock. I will short Varo if I can.
5. Varo uses diversity and inclusion only in its marketing, in my 6 months there, I have not seen a single person of color. Just check their CEO, CPO, CMO, its a complete whitewash. Having few Chinese and Indians in a Silicon Vally company does count."

There are no robots, forklifts are old and falling apart, the amount of politics is astounding, and the pay is not competitive. 
- Favoritism. As others have said, if you're not a favorite, it doesn't matter how much knowledge or experience you have, you're not moving anywhere.

991,1,Not a Good MNC by the End of 2022,"1. For juniors and foreigners looking for a starting career in Singapore, this company is a good stepping stone; the company seems to prefer hiring low wage workers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this may change in 2023 as minium wages rise. The pattern for juniors and foreigners is to work about 1-2 years and switch to other company. See the cons for long-term career consideration in this company. 2. Diversity exists, but seems in a bad way (see cons). 3. There is annual company stock discount for all full-times. 4. There is online learning coverage for Udemy and Coursera. 5. Working culture is hybrid for non-critical businesses. Government business and manufacturing are still on-site. 6. Work-life balance is pretty good. There will be no WLB when deadlines are close though. 7. IT technology (VPN, automatic software updates, etc) is good enough.","1. Salary is below the market average, yet job roles can be demanding. However, this may change in 2023 as minium wages rise. 2. Diversity, mostly are Indonesian, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, is likely due to the above point. My previous project leader who was a fresh grad from Indonesia university was pissed off knowing my starting salary was higher than his. 3. Promotion is based on both seniority and pleasing the management / French people rather than merits / skills. The effect is brilliant people leave after about 2-3 years of working and those in technical and management roles are filled with the average or bad ones. 4. Turnover rate is high and this company even gives 2000 SGD for a successful candidate hiring recommendation, close to what this company gives for a successful patent (1000-1500 EUR). 5. There are several high-ego managers and toxic colleagues. Sabotage and backstabbing do exist and you will be hardly be able to protect yourself when dealing with these toxic people. See point 3 on why this is happening. 6. Codebase for development, production, and unit test code are chaotic. It gives headache just to read them and make you think everyone in this company is an amateur at best. See point 3 on why this is happening. 7. Project leaders and managers do not strive for good development practice. Code refactoring is treated as a burden and unprofessional, coding shortcuts are perceived as brilliant and professional, and most teams have their agile development as just ""being agile"" with short daily stand-up as 1-1-5 hour daily reporting. See point 3 on why this is happening. 8. Most French colleagues I have worked with are cunning, self-entitled, and arrogant towards Asian. Some of them (expats) is incompetent and they make themselves as the most impactful contributor. Yet, they have the highest salary among locals. They mostly appear nice, which is why it is hard to identify this issue. 9. Politics are strong in higher managements, especially if it is related to French people. 10. Not many brilliant people to work with and the experts' expertise are questionable. This is a cybersecurity company focused on applied cryptography and yet, most people inside do not have strong cryptography knowledge. Nobody even cares good software development practice. 11. There is not much career progression for higher positions. 12. Health insurance coverages are average; no dental and annual health screening coverage. 13. The HR technology is bad. HR uses Workday for performance review and company structure, but other than that, it uses Oracle technology (as far as I remember). Critical aspects such as claiming benefits, downloading payrolls, applying leaves, filling monthly check-ins become hellish. 14. Never trust anonymous survey as being anonymous no matter what the managements say. I have had my hard lesson."

Senior leaders spend alot of time gossiping and creating cliques, they are openly talking about staff and other leaders. There are leaders who use their role to bully and intimidate which is well known as complaints are made but nothing will be done about it - there is no safeguarding for non-management staff and relation happens. Alot of things in a short time: staff made to cry on calls, staff working while sick, requests not to take holiday, delivery metric manipulation to punish teammembers, requests for camera turn on despite valid reasons, burnout of teammembers...

Most people are working evenings and weekends and, still, on multiple occasions I have seen people being fired before the replacement is onboarded (= 0 handover) and more stress for teams. 
It is a generally unhappy place to work outside of the relationships with your colleagues, the workload is unrealistic and stressful.

I felt like they didn't care about me or my team, and didn't have a good idea of what we were doing.

People were regularly talked over or shouted down by one manager when they tried to speak up. Employees were regularly talked negatively about behind their back, and there was a culture of backstabbing. Little to no concern for the development of employees. I was constantly working on additional professional certifications while there, not once was it ever mentioned. You were expected to stay in your lane and only in your lane. Suggestions for improving things or ideas to save money were met with denunciation rather than appreciation. If you get sick with Covid for a while, don't expect any leniency when it comes to arbitrarily-set deadlines.

-Management heirarchy is not followed or respected which adds to the toxic environment at every level. The only person/opinion that counts is that of the 3 brothers. Since that is the case, they should not bring people in with position titles.

13,2,Digital Sales Irving TX is a mixed bag,"Microsoft really does have Cadillac benefits - generous 401k matching, best dental insurance I’ve ever had, personal wellness, ESPP etc. Due to the name recognition and company footprint, it’s generally easy to get appointments with your customers, as they are heavily invested in Microsoft technology. Microsoft seems to be continuously innovating their tech as of late, which is helpful to sellers.","Microsoft’s inside sales org in Irving, TX is called Digital Sales within Microsoft’s Small, Medium &amp; Corporate business segment. 
When I joined Microsoft, I expected a world class and extremely formalized training program since the company was so large and talks about digital transformation with their customers. Microsoft was the worst and most impersonal onboarding I’ve ever had. They had you do a quick 2 hour meeting with an HR rep, and from there, you’re released to your manager. On day 1, I had boxes of equipment at my desk and was left to unpack and set up all my equipment myself. No one helped me get up and running to ensure I had a successful first day in role. 
Outside of the standard education videos, which are all more Microsoft and product focused, there was no formalized training to set external hires up for success within Microsoft digital sales. 
It surprised me that for a tech company, the sales tools available are very archaic and systems do not talk to one another. For example, I spent the first 2-3 weeks of my job entering Help Desk tickets with India just to wait on various system access and tools needed to perform my job. This added to what’s already a stressful time starting a new job. Dynamics is a very antiquated CRM tool (basically an electronic filing cabinet) &amp; was cumbersome to maintain accurate sales records in the tool. 
Management within the org was highly political and would impose constantly shifting priorities that worked well for those in leadership to meet their scorecard metrics by creating business rules that forced reps to sell certain products for a management scorecard and jump through countless internal approval hoops if the product was not included in a deal. This led to many reps selling through discounting versus solution selling - setting a bad precedent for future deals. 
There was also a shift in how the specialists teams interact with the digital Account Executives. Some of the specialists used to be AEs and work as field-based resources, while other AEs have 100% inside-based specialists supporting their accounts. Seems like eventually Microsoft will pivot to eliminating either one group of resources or the other in the future. As a result, mandates come down for the AEs to upskill by taking various certification exams to achieve deeper proficiency in the workloads. This is fine, but it makes you wonder if the goal is eventually to try and eliminate some of the specialists. Often, it felt like they were trying to pile as much on the AE as possible when the AE role was explained to me as a generalist sales role. 
Many of the managers within digital sales are extremely duplicitous and political, which created a hostile work environment. Policies would be implemented very haphazardly without the proper training and context for the AE community to fully understand the new policies and adhere to them. 
Since it’s Microsoft, there are also a TON of resources (usually contractors) reaching out internally asking you to intro them to your customers or bothering you constantly to let them engage in your accounts. The issue is many of these resources are also inconsistent and not showing value, so you are having to filter through a ton of internal noise and requests for introductions on top of your daily work. 
The majority of the folks there seemed to be hanging on from when Microsoft first opened this sales org due to the relatively high pay for inside sales; however, many of these employees lack the basic skills and Microsoft knowledge to effectively do their job and take care of their customers - they are just there riding the wave. 
I’d advise against the Digital Sales AE role and Specialist roles in Las Colinas unless you’re have worked heavily in the Microsoft ecosystem and come to the role with that background and knowledge of what you are getting into. If you come from another software company, you will likely not get the enablement your need to effectively navigate the complexities of Microsoft and management’s constantly shifting priorities."

The gas cards and the pep boys accounts don’t even work some of the time, and they ask employees to pay out of pocket to cover the expenses with a promised reimbursement. Most of the issues could be avoided if they just stayed ahead of the potential issues. They also don’t listen to most of the employees unless you’re buddies with the cronies up top in management. A lot of ego’s running this company concerned with their appearance and not concerned with tangible value they add to their employees lives or more important their customers lives.

I was so excited to be apart of a company that seemed to truly care about their employees and the community in which they operated. Unfortunately after about 11 months with the company, I learned that was not the case.

On my 3rd day of onboarding, the company shut down the department I was hired in. They asked me to move to their sales department, in which I had 0 experience. Once I got into that department, they required me to change my original hours of 8-5 to work the 10-7 shift. That really negatively affected my family but we endured and preserved. In addition, I went above and beyond in that role and was promoted w/ a pay raise w/in 2 months. They then required the team to get their real estate license which took 6 months of studying outside of work hours. That also took me away from my family because of the weekly deadlines I needed to meet. I had to study on the weekends and late evenings. 

Ultimately, I ended up passing and receiving my license for them. However, 2 weeks later they asked me to move back into the department they originally hired me to be in. I was excited to go back but kind of bummed I wasn’t going to be able to utilize the license I just spent 6 months sacrificing for.

When I got to the original department, they heard so many great things about my work ethic in the sales department that they “promoted” me to a role that I did not apply, interview or fully understand the roles and responsibilities. I immediately expressed my reservations about the role but they said it would be fine, they would train me. The first 3 months in the new role (but original department) was slow because they were still recovering and setting up from the previous closure. After 1 month of being fully operational, I re-expressed my concern of the promotion so they said they understood and respected my honesty and put me back into the role I originally was hired for (10 months since being hired). After two weeks into the role, they fired me saying that I didn’t seem to be a good fit for Sundae. After I adapted to EVERY change they through my way. I was even one of the top 3 performers in their sales department for 8 months straight. They gave me a week of severance and sent me packing. They didn’t even offer me to move me back to sales but I soon found out why. 

1 month later, they did a huge lay off and gave those employees a much larger sum of severance. I believe this is maybe their 2nd or 3rd layoff in their 3 years of business. I genuinely believe they just wanted to avoid laying me off and used my honesty against me. I have way more to say but my fingers hurt lol.

The night job is pretty fun when you get along with your colleagues
No management to deal with on nights","Poor management - take advantage of the fact most colleagues cannot lose their jobs with no notice as a tactic for bullying and threatening behaviour. They basically like to think they own you.
No appreciation - you can have a really busy night and still get everything done and more, with not even a thank you. Help out at other branches again with no thank you, from your manager or the manager at the other branch.
Lack of understanding regarding how it is more difficult to sleep during the day due to life noise of the world, light and heat.
Poor attitude and behaviour from management - especially when they are coming in at the end of a long night. 
Lack of training - Training/continuous training is none existent for night staff, my induction was a 9-5 shift during the day in which I spent most of it on a till serving customers on my own. And the only training I got was regarding day shift jobs/procedures. I got 2 night shifts training with 2 Customer Assistants in which they are not paid extra to do, and after that I was pretty much on my own. 
Extra tasks that get pushed onto night shift are not communicated effectively leading to us been scolded because the task wasn't done/done incorrectly, for task which we have never been trained to do. Management just expects us to figure it out. 
Poor ineffective communication - Finding out after going to work that you were suppose to be at another branch therefore no communication regarding working at other stores, telling other store assistants and hoping the message gets through to the right people.
It feels like the morning management settings are downright hostility or apathy. neither of which make you feel good at the end of a shift."

Band 4+ are lazy and chase trophies based on the work their employees do without rewarding those that actually do the work.
427,5,"You will learn a lot about being a leader, and how to work with others",Its extremely fun to work here and its cupcake sales. Stalwart Concepts works with a good brand and provides an fun and friendly environment. I had a good time there just had to move out of state. They helped me transfer to a similar office down in a Miami but if you are in Tampa this is the place to be!!!,The downside to working at Stalwart Concepts or any job that is performance based is you find out quick how much you are willing to hard hard towards a goal. I found myself getting upset  with my results but at the end I knew that I was not giving it my all.  If you overcome yourself and find a rhythm within the company you will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to advance.

Nothing is done to stop it. -There is favoritism in all departments. -Micromanagement. -Management that does not do anything.

752,1,Horrible experience stemming from upper management &amp; owners,The only pros that were present are now gone as most of the forward-thinking staff were left unheard and found better opportunities elsewhere.,"- Fear of rats as there were over 20 in the warehouse
- Absolutely no room for growth, managers will keep you where you are by doing mindless repetitive tasks
- Direct managers are not on your side, they will take all credit to make themselves appeal to the owner

- You will not be paid even remotely close to industry averages
- Proposals to better the company will not be considered and you will not be heard

- Managers act as if they are doing important tasks, but are actually just browsing their phones
- False promises of career advancements, wage increases, work from home options
- Gossip across the entire toxic company, rooting from upper management
- Everything must be taken with a grain of salt, managers will refute any past promises by twisting and cherry-picking their words/offers
- Forced office culture, where rearrangements of desks and seating arrangements occurred often and obnoxious techno music was played for 5+ hours straight
- Micromanagement even when tasks are elementary
- Extremely high turnover
- Managers always choose the options that further decline revenue due to a lack of experience
- Air conditioners were never on to save costs even when temperatures hit above 30 degrees, warehouse and office became ovens"

Even though I was the person with the most experience in the technology we were using my ideas were overshadowed, and larger projects had to be pushed off for deadlines.  The turnover was also high, even within my team.  We had people rotating in and out, lots of input for a lot of different sources on progress/expectations, and it led to something of a jumbled mess when it came to development."
325,4,Finance,Great company! Many good people. Friendly atmosphere. Great place to begin your career. Great entry level positions. Good pay.

Managements more concern about perception of performance rather than actually delivering quality results."
984,2,Not the same,Great product line and good service,Very little growth opportunity. Not enough employees for the work load.
23,3,Great company ruined by horrible management,"There was a lot to learn when I first joined Getir, my teammates (and my boss) were amazing people and I quickly developed a business acumen that I have yet to lose after a year and a half of being on the more technical side of things. I was able to establish deep and meaningful relationships with my teammates and working was enjoyable.","Once they started bringing in former consultants into C-level positions, things started going downhill. I get that both the founders and these people are really smart and talented, but you need to have a certain degree of professionalism (as in, not putting your sons in positions that they are vastly underqualified for) and a certain history in the company in order to not mess things up. Granted, the boost from the pandemic helped things a lot but the company also started swelling up with underqualified people in redundant positions, which caused the few people who were doing actual work to become overburdened really quickly. And management was nowhere to be seen."

834,1,Not as advertised,"Learning, travel, being chill work, fooling management","Politics, too much politics, a lot of preferential treatment by religious zealots"
204,1,"Worst place to work, terrible culture, toxic work environment",you have a job that pays well enough. Health benefits were pretty good.,"There are several individuals who are extremely toxic to work with and continue to diminish and ridicule others. There is a lot of in-fighting and pointing fingers. You will get blamed for all the problems upper-management created. There is not a lot of room to grow and the skills you learn here are not very transferrable in my opinion. A lot of home brewed applications. They do not value anyone who speaks up and tries to change things, they do not value quality or hardwork. You only are successful if you are one of the drinking buddies in my opinion. They are very deceptive in the hiring process for most people - this place is riddled with problems and they over promise in interviews. STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE."
631,3,"Loved the job, and some of the people","I loved my job and was given a lot of freedom to grow and design/implement projects as I saw fit. Pay was alright, perks were AMAZING. Man, I miss the food and kitchen staff. And the food. Gained a lot of experience and made a lot of cool friends and was able to further my career goals. Would have stayed a lot longer if I could have transferred to another team.","The perks distract you from the people that suck and project budget allocation mismanagement. Also contractors are not treated equally - some of the full time employees go out of their way to not make friends that are contractors since ""they'll be gone in 2 years anyways"". Engineering was flippant and rude to support staff and treated like kings no matter what. Literally had someone be racist to my face about COVID and nothing was done about it. Also saw multiple contractors reduced to tears over the way they were treated. Having the company name on my resume is valuable in the tech world, and they know that so they can skimp on some areas."

2. Directly or Indirectly forcing employees to attend office during covid times"
435,1,Broken people in a broken workplace,There are few pros to this place.,"- Poor leadership
- Hostile Working Environment
- Insufficient personnel for training
- Exploitation of temporary workers
- Lack of HR presence


I wasn't there long, but I was gaslit, slandered, and otherwise abused throughout the day-nearly every day I was there. My coworkers would spend a couple hours throughout the day just gossiping about people in and out of the office including me, our supervisor, people in other departments, etc. all within earshot. The supervisor wasn't any better as every other word that came out of his mouth was sarcastic; severely lacking critical communication skills. I ended up having to work closely with a sociopathic teenager that he entrusted with my training and ended up being taught the exact opposite details of my duties- which management refuted when I mentioned it. I'm sure this was all for the sake of ensuring job security for her and others in the office that also played their hand in manipulating the situation. If you end up working here, good luck. You're swimming upstream."
154,1,CSR / Travel Sales Associate Experience,1. The building that the headquarters in Richmond is located in is very nice.,"1. No matter what they tell you, it's an inbound call center.  You are expected to be available on the phones from the literal second (that's recorded) you log on, to the literal second (also recorded) you log off. You are given two 10 minute breaks, and a choice between a 30 minute or 60 minute lunch. If you choose the latter, your day is extended to accommodate the lost time on the phone. 
2. If you somehow end up in this situation with a degree, you will be reporting to an immediate supervisor whose highest tier of education is high school. This individual is responsible for pulling calls you took, supposedly at random, and critiquing them. If you fail an absurd metric, such as forgetting to provide a canned sequence of information at the end of a call, you will fail. Fail a call and you will forfeit any possibility of seeing a monthly bonus. 
3. Monthly bonuses: During my time in this position, my team generated premiums in excess of one million dollars every month for six months straight. If you failed a call, you would not realize any bonus for your contributions.  Fear not, for you WILL receive a rubber bracelet similar to the LIVE STRONG bracelets that instead reads ""Million Dollar Club.""  In addition, you will receive a coupon for a cup of soup redeemable at the cafe downstairs in the lobby. 
4. Employee Appreciation Days: Other departments are invited and welcome to join outdoor cookouts and half days with a cold beer. It looked very pleasant actually. I would have enjoyed them had we not been required to remain on the phones to continue servicing calls instead.
5. Staff Development: Career development is probably something that is valued in other departments. However if you are one of the unfortunate souls that make up the claims, customer service, or sales departments - you're doomed. During my two years there, I knew of only one person able to break out of these departments in a vertical transition to something like Finance, Underwriting, or Marketing. 
6. Weekends &amp; Holidays: If you are in this role, you will be working alternating weekends. I have heard that since I left, you actually are compensated better for the mandatory weekend rotations. That being said, you are also expected to work Holidays. Every time you work a holiday, you accrue points. If you have enough points by the time a major holiday rolls around, say Christmas, there is a lottery system in place that works like a draft. If you do not have enough holiday points, you're working Christmas. While I was there, I worked every major holiday including Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
7. Hourly Pay: As stated above, I'm aware that there has since been adjustments to the hourly rate of CSR and Sales. When I was there, the base pay for normal business schedule was $13 / hour. If you wanted to see the most pay, you had to be willing to work from 4:00PM until midnight for $15 / hour. 
8. PTO: You must accrue the PTO before you can actually use it. You may not take off the same day that someone else on your team has reserved. There must always be enough people on the phones to service calls. 
9. The calls: Be prepared to deal with the absolute worst that this planet has to offer in terms of humanity or lack-thereof. You are the front lines for servicing phone calls for disgruntled customers that were foolish enough to fall for the product this company sells in the first place. The majority of your calls will be to either refund people that mistakenly purchased the policy at the time of purchasing tickets, or sell the policy itself, or notify a customer that their claim is not covered by the policy. I unfortunately had to tell numerous cancer patients that their condition was considered pre-existing and likely would not be covered by the policy at the time that they filed. By the end of the day, it was more common that I received some sort of death wish from a cancer patient than not. I can't say that I blame them. 
10. Management: They are aware of all of this. They do not care. They will always have a pool of people to draw from that hold a high school diploma, or are under employed with a bachelor's degree."
76,1,Do youself a favor - RUN!,You get paid on time,"All you do is to have meaningless meetings and hear others talking about your work because for reasons unknown, one or two ""stars"" in the team get to present everything. Some of your coworkers who just graduated from an average school a few years ago for reasons unclear to me take themselves to be the ""expert"" in the field, and definitely acted like they are better than the rest of the team and kept telling you what to do. I can go on with how toxic it is to work there, but you can save yourself some trouble and avoid this place. Oh btw, you better do whatever the leadership team tell you to do - including coming to the office to meet in person otherwise you'll be fired."
731,5,Encourages creative thinking,Enjoyed management’s hands-off approach. Allowed me to explore solutions in a creative manner. “One size fits all” does not exist with this company.,High workload that was extremely involved.
447,1,Meh,Not great at all yeah,Will overwork you if you let them
189,1,"Nice if you want to move, but there is a mental price tag.","You can get your documents when you want to move here, plus have a view if you're lucky.","The promotion is only about the city, and you will get a little bit of money, but NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS EXPECTED AS IN TASKS...... Nice city, I can move, yeah you can do this even without this company. Their payments are later than late, and if you make use of their moving package, you're basically bound to them for several months. And then is the question if you will ever see the money again. The salary offered is just a joke, without any compensation. 

Once enrolled, it might look impressive, but it's not. First two weeks are vague, but it will fall together later. Then there are another 2 weeks, where they will teach you what you can't say. Just throw it out of the window once you start. Just call the people and beg them to work with you. Straight out of the training there is no one that will help you, you have to figure it out. They only care about numbers and how many you have reached. You are a number to them, and if you are not able to perform you will get a lot of judgement and look downs. 

The company itself is just one hot mess, especially when it comes to documentation, finance and communication. No person is treated the same and basically you sit there with your brave face, waiting to go home. No matter how independent you are, it is a job that requires no feelings, a lot of lying, and a skin so thick and strong no drill can enter. If you are not an agent, you're doomed to get the lowest of the lowest tasks, which is basically taking the remainings. 


Last but not least, the invisible HR department that barely reacts and do not want to be bothered. What they are doing is a big question mark. Instead hiring profesionals they take everyone and send someone of hire management to micromanage. Especially operational departments who apparently doing very bad in the numbers."

237,2,"Mis Managed, unsustainable, unstable","- Discount on clothing
- Great Commission when you hit goals
- Growth in the company if you prove loyal to growing w/company
- Creating close-knit family relationships with coworkers","- Mis Managed by Founder, CEO which trickled down to upper management
- Upper Management made it obvious they were taking advantage of their high pay by being irresponsible with how they treated store managers/workers
- A lot of upper management people knew their company had laid back valued with freedom, so they definitely took advantage while they could
- Very little assistance with store managers that needed the help the most
- Immature upper management lead to a lot of unprofessional ways they would manage store associates 
- Profit Minded, but never treated the salespeople with the respect they deserved. You know, since the sales folx were the only people actually selling their product."
488,1,Toxic 'Family' Culture,"Good pay
Good benefits
Some really good people that work there","FAST was more than just a job, it was a lifestyle. And they promoted that lifestyle left and right and the FAST family as being so important. But taking a step back now I realize how toxic it was. The family aspect was just there because we were not given a life outside of FAST. Even if you accrued enough PTO to see your family, you felt guilty using too much of it because you would be letting others down being gone for too long. As a family we were suppose to forgive FAST for their mistakes (not getting the project you wanted, having to do crappy tasks, traveling at a moments notice to fix someone else's mistake) but if you messed up once you are basically shunned like a pariah, and a lot of the company talks about your mistakes for years to come sometimes. 

It also took me stepping away to realize how much sexual harassment was blatant. By the partners themselves, by the client, by the coworkers, it is disgusting. And reaching out to other higher-up women in the company to talk to them about it (which I did on multiple occasions) just gets you told that 'that's how it is' and 'I went through the same thing'. 

This company was so much a part of my life and it really hurt to leave, but I am so happy I did. I wish everyone the best of luck there, but it isn't a culture that is healthy for most people, especially women."

513,1,Zero Work Life Balance for Production Team,"Great employees, fun after work activities","I will be forever grateful for my time at Lemonlight, I met incredible people and gained a lot of experience. However I would never recommend this as a place to work and would warn everyone before applying. LL seems like a great work place at first. Unlimited PTO, free lunches and dinners, after hours company events. It seems great. But then reality quickly sets in and the brutal truth appears. There is no work balance, people pull in 10, 12, 14 hour days weekly. The workload is impossible to get through in a normal 8 hour work day but you are expected to get it done. Being paid salary and having no OT, the hours are brutal and unhealthy. I have seen multiple people break down to tears because the stress is just too much. The production team work on the weekends and on holidays to get their work done and the team’s morale is always at an all time low. There is a reason there are only a handful of employees that have been there over a year. It’s surprising when anyone reaches their year mark and should be a red flag to anyone applying. There are anonymous polls that go out monthly asking employees to leave their honest remarks on how LL can do better and address certain problems. I’m not sure if these surveys are sent directly to the trash bin, but there has never been a single response to help address employee’s concerns. Instead they will distract you with a pizza party. The actual team is all incredible, it’s why most people stay for as long as they do. Management has no grasp of reality on how to support their team instead they focus on shifting blame and finding scapegoats. If people don’t quit on their own after reaching their breaking point, they are fired out of nowhere with no explanation. You never feel a sense of job security as you can plainly see their attitude of people being expendable. So in the end, I stand by my original statement that I am grateful for my time at Lemonlight. My only regret leaving Lemonlight is that I didn’t leave sooner."

370,4,A company that hires incredible people,"Some of the best people I've ever worked with. One of the best things about working here is that everyone cares about their work and always strives to improve our processes and share learnings with each other. The team is highly collaborative, talented, and is always willing to listen to one another. There is a great sense of teamwork even after moving to remote work.

There is opportunity to grow and explore new roles if you voice your interest. In my experience, management is very supportive and does the best they can to make sure you continue to grow your career.

I've seen many older reviews about bad management and micromanaging. A few years ago I might have agreed, but the investment into management the past couple years has turned it all around. There are some incredible, hard working, and smart managers here who truly care about individuals on their team.

Every company has rough patches and Eventmobi certainly has had some, but what I appreciate here is that if you give feedback, there are always people ready to discuss and work with you to solve the problem.","Things move quickly and you need to be able to adapt.

150,2,Unfair termination,The job is work from home.,"Management is lazy, everyone makes up rules as they go so no one is the same page then they try to hold you responsible for their slip ups. Only communication is teams so nothing is recorded. One manager says one thing and then one says another. Nothing about the job is professional until they want to get on you about something while the mangers can have kids crying dogs barking side conversations with spouses during team meetings but have the nerve to ask for your professionalism. After management bullied me into working on my day off on my sons birthday they had the nerve to use my computer dying as a reason to fire me. They also allowed me to work in the hospital during my sons surgery on my hotspots because they would rather that then be short handed and also used that as a reason to fire me since they couldn’t hold

400,1,CORPORATE COMPANY DISGUISED BY GREEN WASHING,"connecting with new people, discount, great health insurance","It took my nearly my entire time with the company (+3 years) to realize that the poor, unfair, and unethical treatment of people, myself included, is part of what led to my incredibly high stress levels that then led to an autoimmune diagnosis and the obvious need for the health insurance they provided - that we do pay for btw! It is not paid for by the company. 
It makes better sense to put my mental health first which means leave the company and then theoretically there is less of a desperate need and want for great health insurance. They thrive on knowing that people mainly chose to stay after all the injustice just for the health insurance. They thrive on keeping people unwell. Sounds all too familiar (like how our ""health care"" industry is run in this country).

Scott Nash gives power away to the most mediocre people and they take the power to their head and absolutely hold it over other people. Scott Nash cares about profit over people and planet. His greed of money and power is evident as the company continues to grow while the staffing becomes less and less. I have met few really great people here and they either quit or get fired unfairly - or are threatened off the clock so nothing can be done about it with HR. 

""If you can't beat them, join them"" only works if you have numbers because there is power in numbers. Do not think for a single second that you alone will change ANYTHING about how this place is run from the top down. To begin, the company needs a new owner and nearly all of management (lower and upper) needs to be replaced. That won't happen.

Management is literally the WORST I've ever experienced and this comes from someone who has worked in and with the public for greater than 12 years in a variety of retail spaces. The mediocrity of people they put in management will leave you laughing - because it is very much a joke. Managers who bully, harass, or are totally absent minded. Brainless. Heartless. Lacking compassion. Self serving. Ego addicts. Drug and sex addicts - while on the clock!!! Managers who work in pajamas and rags for clothes, people who downright smell fowl and need to shower - what a way to set an example of self respect but yet they expect us to respect them.

Management does not live up to, nor do they set good examples for, the company values. All that while being encouraged to speak your truth and you dare risk your job if you do! Only expect HR to protect your job IF it is convenient for them to do so. Otherwise, expect to get fired.

The company knowingly employees thieves and sexual predators, harassers and offenders, and less and less cares about the employees at the bottom level which is evident given the lack of security cameras, because the owner Scott does not believe in using them - so basically you work at your own risk of being thieved from or worse, sexually, emotionally, and psychologically abused. So much abuse of power. So much abuse against humanity. It's literally the same stuff you see in the media but on a smaller scale and at a local level.

NOT a ""green"" job for you if you truly care about the environment, will only make you mad and stress you out to be so exposed to people who actually do not care, workers and customers both. Didn't even mention the amount of financial waste that happens here, mostly due to pure human error, yet you are told there is no money for wage increases (but yet they keep opening new stores with little to no team to even recruit). 

It doesn't matter if you have a family to support or if you are single-handedly keeping plastic bags from becoming trash by turning them into new, repurposed goods. IT'S NOT WORTH SACRIFICING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, WORK FOR A DIFFERENT COMPANY. It's easier to know from the start you are working with people who openly don't care versus working with people who pretend to when its convenient for them. 

MOM's is the most dishonest place I have ever and will ever be employed."

This will typically last less than 2 weeks before you start getting clients. Once you start getting clients, you are on your own. If you have a question about any task at that point, they will refer you to some training manual. You also will be given some extremely difficult clients with unrealistic expectations. If those unrealistic expectations aren't met, they will fire you with no warning. Get ready to work insane hours just to be caught up with overdue. Be prepared to get yelled at when you don't finish work on time. For context, you may get assigned a client that requires 80 hours of work A WEEK, and they will expect those 80 hours to be done end of the week, even if you have to work all night they don't care. Don't waste your time working here there are many other SEO jobs out there that have a better culture, support, and benefits."
810,3,A Real look at IMTOB,"Great package, Great Benefits, great life style company

Excellent place to work hard and earn a lot, not great if you want to develop as a person","You must devote a lot of home real-estate to make a 'home office'

Out of hours work for no extra pay

No clear development strategy"
791,1,"Great mission, terrible leadership.","The products are awesome and there were some really great and talented people who cared very deeply about the mission. 
The commeraderie between peers was great.","There are so many cons! 

Let's start with the leadership team which is likely the worst part about RapidDeploy: 

The CEO is THE WORST. 
He manipulates, abuses and threatens his staff. He makes promises to customers that the company cannot uphold. He pretends to care, but actually only cares about himself. He needs to go in order for the company to succeed. He refuses to listen to the top talent that the company hires and does what he wants anyways. The staff turn around in the C-Suite is shocking, I suspect it is because nobody can work with such an ego-maniac. 

There are C-Level Execs who milk the system for their own benefit, spending all day on personal stuff while raking in huge salaries all while BSing their way through. Anyone who tries to challenge this is worked out and this is in large part of why the company is where is. 

There is a lot of nepotism. Old school friends and the like who have been hired and put into positions where they are not qualified to be. Many work at the company, earning huge salaries, while providing very little value. 

Leadership does not take any responsibility for anything that goes wrong. The way in which over 100 people were laid off was disgusting to say the least. There was a Teams call one week before Christmas, during which the CEO announced said lay-offs and was never heard from again. Not even so much as an apology. Absolute radio silence from the man who has so much to say normally was not only cowardly, but also a massive slap in the face to everyone who had been working tirelessly to make the company a success. For months and months we were told that the company is doing great. Another indication that the leadership team has no idea what they are doing.

After 100+ people were laid off with very a basic severance, the remaining company received bonuses. Very publicly at that too. This was in such bad taste. 

RapidDeploy hires people wrecklessly, and often those people end up having side-lined careers. There is very much a culture of throw8ng people at problems but then not listening to what the solution would really be. Everyone who joins is considered the next best thing, only to be sidelined by the next person. You'll almost NEVER be good enough and will likely be overlooked for new talent every single time. 

There is no desire to upskill existing talent. When approaching the management to do certain courses, they will try to talk you out of it or will try put it off. However, in interviews the approach is different and candidates are sold a dream.

When the rot started to show, several negative reviews were noted here on Glass Door. Management then went on a campaign to up the ratings, which is why there are positive reviews with similar wording. 

There are too many chief's, not enough indians. Everyone wants to be a manager with a fancy title, but not many know what they are doing. Fancy titles at RapidDeploy really glorify basic positions that should not be management level. 

After months and months of telling people not to worry, the ship took on major water and had to rid itself of over 100 employees. Over 100 families were affected by this and South African Employees are still awaiting severance pay outs. 

The fact of the matter is, stay away, they will sell you dreams, derail your career and lie to you every step of the way. Trust in management has been lost completely and it won't be long before more people leave and the doors close for good. Everyone wants to have fancy titles, high paying salaries and then make it seem like they are doing you a favor when you actually expect them to do their jobs."

408,3,Grill-fry and Line,Good experience for fast-paced work and a great job for young teens to develop skills.,Managers and customers can get cranky when not satisfied.
538,3,"Good Starter Job, but Company Growing Pains Present Issues","The job is relatively easy once the learning curve of primary cell isolation is done. I would say we are overpaid for the role, but because we are on call every other week, it can be considered justified. The company provides free food and snacks, so I never have to pay for lunch or food if I don't want to. The people on my team are great and cooperative since the job is generally low-stress. My manager is amazing and accommodating, but my boss is too hard on us and has moods that end up flowing inappropriately into work. I do not have any other experience working in manufacturing, so I can't say how well management handles things or how benefits compare to other companies. We get paid medical and dental, and have free vision, disability, and life. I believe minimal paid parental leave is in the works for 2023.","There are not really advancement opportunities within the team outside of tech lead, which is held over us to keep us on the team. The team itself is mostly manufacturing rather than RnD (unlike what I was told in my interview), which can make things boring and repetitive if you require variety. We are on call every other week. It's part of the job, but not ideal for busy people. I get called in out of normal business hours about 4 times per month, but the call schedule is released 1-2 months in advance for planning purposes. The PTO for the position is about 10 days per year, (accrues based on how long you have been on) plus 1-2 flex holidays. Most employees at Miromatrix are nice to work with, but there are growing pains associated with being a startup that cause a lot of people stress. I left because the job was not right for my work style and because of my boss’s actions and words towards the techs and my manager. My boss is extraordinarily hard on us and their frequent mood swings keep us on edge and worried about our standing in the team. During inclement weather, the executive team often works from home but refuses to let technicians stay home, even when activities at work are minimal to none."
621,1,Don't work here unless you want to work lots of hours for little pay,It can be a fun place to work and outsiders think you're cool because you work there.,"The organization is sclerotic to the point of not being able to correct procedural problems that have existed for decades.  They tout the fact that they promote from within but they promote based not on what you know or how good of a worker you are, but on how many hours of overtime you're willing to work and how much abuse you're willing to take.  They only want yes men.  They are committed to paying their employees as little as possible and do not give employees performance reviews or have any mechanism for raises once you've been hired at your starting rate, other than to compete for a different higher paying position.  To be considered, you better be working 6 or 7 days per week for years to prove to them that you're worthy."

Business units struggling for individual survival and forced to go in opposing directions. Projects often disrupted after much work is complete. Widespread denial of complexity. Tech stack is disjoint, chaotic, and outdated. Attrition of senior technical talent is crippling. Multiple engineering cultures jammed together but none are modern."
246,1,Save yourself,Very corporate and as long as management likes you then you can pretty much do whatever you want.,This is the most toxic company I've ever worked for. Management likes to preach their core values and brand promise it's nothing more than propaganda to brainwash their employees. There is a reason they can't keep employees around and why staffing is a revolving door. If you like constantly feeling like you're not good enough this is the perfect place for you.

It depends on the team in which you will be enrolled. Not all teams are good. In my team leads even don't know how to git push and all. He will simply dump the work on you if he is not able to do that. Leads are enjoying their life like a government job. As of now, I haven't got any support from him related to the codebase or anything instead I am the one who guides him.

Hikes are very less. This is one thing everyone feels here. No goodies or anything you can expect here. They have annual promotion criteria. Like other few companies have quarterly promotion as well."

The owners of this company will cuss you out, constantly threaten you with dismissal, and overload you with objectives that serve no real purpose. No sick days, no maternity leave, no 401k. Relationships with other employees are greatly frowned upon. So no after work drinks with the co-workers. They'll be some long nights and ruff days. You will be expected to over deliver, all the time, with little to no reward.

If you're considering working here, be ready to see management have mental break downs, marital disputes, and a colleague or two crying their eyes out after a department meeting. You will also notice that as quickly as a person is hired there will be one or two people quitting or fired just as fast. No one and I do mean no one gets a good reference from this place. Moving on to another position is viewed as betrayal. Overall, employment here is no where near worth the stress, effort, and pay offered. Don't believe me read other posts from past employees. Anyone saying different is most likely the owners them selves.  I have no animosity towards management as I no longer work there, I however cannot in good conscience recommend this place

Depending on the mood of these people, that is how your day is going to go. And however they think their department should be worked, is how it should be, no questions asked. They like their department to be very personalized to what fits them.

These folks are the very problem of this store. Anyone who comes in as a new hire can have all the grocery experience they could ever need. It won't matter, the person running the department you are assigned to will teach you how it's going to go down, and it's wrong, inefficient and costs the company a ton of money.

They can't keep anyone, craigslist is always spammed by at least 15+ posting from the store. I don't know how management puts up with it."

During the pandemic and making money hand over fist they decided to recruit for fun, and did so by offering a truly hybrid approach to working, without a single thought for what the landscape would look like post Covid, that has lead to the company being obscenely over recruited and forced redundancies, that mess has to sit with the SMT. Pretty distressing being made redundant, my call lasted 8 minutes, I was told to shut my laptop, that was they last time a human being spoke to me at AO. They love to talk about culture, the CEO wonders around thinking the culture is fantastic..... it might be in Bolton, but he should try getting out into the network and look at the reasons that attrition rates are over 75%, employed drivers 110%. You've got a logistics network management team that are blatantly uninterested in people, just look at the way they pay their self employed drivers! If your route is planned at 10 hours, it's likely to take 13, but you only get paid for the 10, they caveat that with if it takes 7 you get the 10..... that never happens by the way. If you sift through the reviews you'll see many of them aren't favourable at all, best way to combat that.... Ask people to write good reviews.... but only those they know to be happy. They don't trust their employees, hybrid working, was any 2 days a week in the office, that changed to 3 days, of which Monday and Friday would be 2. How else do you say ""we don't trust you, without actually saying, we don't trust you?!"""

518,2,Retrospective on WWS,"Great team of talented people, catered food, good office environment, entry-level game-industry positions, health/dental benefits/life insurance.","Job Security is at about a 0 at the moment after the previous layoff. There aren't any negatives about the enviroment while I was there, and the reports of mysogyny/sexism in the workspace isn't true as far as im aware, the team was more-or-less caring but I'm pretty sure as of right now the situation is more desperate as they're trying to get the most out of employees as stated by others who recently left, and more than half of people there are actively seeking other jobs because they lost all sense of job security. Also, management didn't necessarily listen to people that kind of had a better understanding of the Roblox ecosystem, and projects were prone to failure due to a lot of poor game-design decisions, and spending on projects that were simply not of any financial profits. Roblox's game development industry is a very interesting one. There are games on the platform manned by only 2 people and bring in over seven-figures a year, while a VC-Funded In-person office space with over 50 employees at a certain point can't even deliver a relatively successful project besides about 1."
985,2,Know your direct team (school) you work with before deciding to work here.,"Perks are typical to working in sports…games, tickets, gear, etc.
Time off around the holidays.","Many believe that the pay is low because this is the sports industry. However, there is more than enough money to go around. Executives spend more money on dinners, alcohol and travel (often for themselves, not prospects/clients) than one can imagine. Before COVID they would travel on private/semi-private jets to daily/weekly meetings when this could be done over the phone/zoom. Money doesn’t seem to be a problem for this, yet they’re comfortable paying entry-level positions $30k/year.

Commissions is confusing and it comes down to the size of the book you inherit. If you have a small book, you can bring in a ton of money into the company and see only a fraction of a percent of that you brought in.

There are certainly perks with working in sports (tickets, meals, gear, etc.) however the technical “benefits” are pretty weak. There is no 401k match - I’ve never seen a company of this size have zero 401k match. 

Corporate talks about how much of a ""family"" this company is all of the time, then they lay off a ton of people only to repost their jobs a few weeks later."

Poor performers laughed, “They can’t fire us.

Finance teams work with a support accounting team that is based in US, so there is a bad match when you have to partner with the latter team. When they make errors, it is difficult to correct them, as they have a different management and won't respond to anyone but.
No technical training for staff.
While interviewing, was sold a different role than the actual one, so expectations slowly turned out to not match reality of the position.
Environment is slightly toxic, with office politics consuming a lot of time and energy.
Staff have a dual reporting line, one is to their finance leader, while the other, more dotted but no less real, is to the country manager, and therein lies the conflict."

966,1,Toxic and  Dysfunctional Administration Destroying School with Great Potential,"Great opportunity to work one on one with students from diverse backgrounds, learning abilities/styles, personalities, with distinct educational /socio-emotional needs. One on one model allows you to see what strategies are effective/ineffective in a relatively short period of time, which is difficult in a large classroom setting. As you gain more experience teaching, and your knowledge and comfort level in your subject areas grow, and you can bring in resources/tools/learning platforms into your class, which you can use to expand on your craft. Ability to teach basically any class that you would want, is a good opportunity to get experience, especially when it comes to AP courses. There are many highly talented and hard working teachers who are very collaborative, supportive of each other and collegial. Opportunities exist to be an advisor in student groups/clubs during lunch, if one chooses.","High Turnover: Very high teacher and front desk staff turnover. Little to no investment made in staff retention, described by upper administration  as a “stepping stone” job. High turnover creates lack of continuity for students, and constant loss of experienced and talented staff. School seems to either be in denial about this issue or not actually care/realize how such high amounts of staff turnover damages the schools capacity/ability/effectiveness to serve the vulnerable population of students that Tilden serves. The faculty page for the Albany and Walnut Creek campuses have been blank for months. 

Lack of Adequate Teacher Training: Very little training is given towards working with students with learning differences. The very limited teacher training that does exist (20 minutes, once a week, during teacher preparation time) is often topical due to limited time, and does not allow each topic the time and attention that it needs/deserves. Trainings seem to be targeted more toward satisfying reporting requirements rather than actually for the benefit of staff and students. 

Prep Time: An inadequate amount of  time is given for  preparation for one on one class instruction. 1 hour of preparation time is given for every 10 hours of instructional time which is paid at the reduced rate of  $20 an hour (which is well below the $32-$37 an hour pay range for teachers) This inadequacy and devalorization runs in contradiction to one of the schools main points of emphasis of  providing quality individualized instruction. Any class cancellations count against accrued preparation time. 

No Human Resources:  Disciplinary issues are currently handled by upper administration which is a conflict of interest if issues arise involving a member of the upper administrative team. There is an outside HR consultant that is called in at the discretion of upper administration. Day to day HR issues are handled by a member of upper administration who also handles employee benefits/health insurance questions/issues. 

Bullying/Unprofessional Behavior/Nepotism: There has been a long history of unprofessional, bullying and retaliatory behavior perpetuated by current members of the upper administrative team including those who are in charge of curriculum and HR/benefits, who for years has been able to comport themselves in this way with impunity. Numerous complaints (documented &amp; verbal) have been made to the current founders of the school and other persons on the upper management leadership team for years to no effect. Instead, upper management  has acted to ignore, enable, excuse and cover up this behavior to the detriment of teachers, staff, and the school culture. Additionally, over the years many of the top leadership positions have been awarded not through merit and ability, but through a combination of nepotism and as a means to reward those who do not question /are not critical of the decisions made/ actions taken  by members of the upper management team. This encourages  pettiness, immaturity, vindictiveness, insecurity, gossip and insincerity to permeate through the upper levels of the school leadership. All of this creates an environment that is unproductive, toxic, incompetent and uncaring, which has greatly worsened in the last couple of years. 

Other Issues: 

Lack of real control / teacher feedback / collaboration in regards to the development of curriculum. 

No CFO or Controller exists within the school.  

Logistically, administratively and curriculum wise the school is consistently reactive instead of proactive."

You get to flex that you work in a bank","Your ability to get “outcomes” dictates how well you’re doing the job, nothing else

Your performance is then judged solely off personal opinions of customers put in on a survey. Which has so many flaws I couldn’t begin to list here. 

About 3 different times a customer who has had a bad experience somewhere else with TD say the auto insurance department or the C/C department or a different Branch, comes to my branch days later to do transactions then gets a survey for me but decides to give all reds (Yes this actually happened 3 times) because of his/her/their prior experience, that is not close to being my fault fam. And then the MCEs sit with you talking like i could have done something about it???? No matter how EXEMPLARY my service was, they are forced to voice their opinion completely concerning TD and im the fall guy, then the MCE will say “then why didn’t you ask how their experience with TD was”, in two occasions i did and when they voiced this, all i can do is apologize nothing else, after twice this happened the next time the MCEs just said “it happens” yeah duh, not that its the Managers faults but at least my MCEs sometimes acknowledge the surveys have HUGE FLAWS for frontline associates (LCEA/CEA or Tellers as laymen say) in my 1 year with TD its happened 3 times, I know one coworker who had it happen numerous times in one quarter (3 months). And then when its not the case, customers bash you on this survey for doing your job. You ask for ID for transactions that need it they get annoyed “(Sir/Ma’m) its compliance, we are protecting you, and us and most importantly your money from any cases of fraud” and then they say “i been with td for blah blah blah years, why you asking for id” Sir i dont’ know you?? I am new and i have never seen you? (I would not be this rude obviously) so I declined to process the transaction, but because they did other transactions with me before, then they get a survey and give all reds, reason cause i did my job, followed rules and compliance, and then they sit me down and complain and I’m just sitting there like you fam CANNOT be serious (in my head 😂). I did my job and you are complaining?, my bad I should have given a lady 10000$ from her A/C with no ID, she claims to have got up to walk her dog so she out of no where needs 10 bands?? HAHAHAHA , she had space for her ACS Card (Debit card) but not Gov ID, and you guys are upset at me for declining like you all told me to do??? THATS RICH. I guess I should have called a manager oh wait i did that once before and the same manager told them the same thing (We need ID for this transaction unfortunately) THAT SAME MANAGER looked me in the eye and said “you shoulda called me or any other mces or the branch or assistant branch manager” what DIFFERENCE would it have made? Haha. Then they said HR has to know blah blah blah yea whatever. HR didn’t even say anything, i doubt they gave a care about it.

Obviously, this is to ensure there's enough coverage on the Helpdesk. But it seems a bit much at times. Breaks and lunch change day to day. 

They can also change your overall hours if needed. The Helpdesk operates 24/7. I started 7:30a-4:30a, but then they were going to move me to 11:00a-7:00p after my main training was completed. That's not what I signed up for and agreed to.

At the time, the KC Fed had a business casual dress code. This was a bit annoying, especially for helpdesk IT staff who don't go anywhere. Part of our team was based out of the Minneapolis Fed and they were able to dress casual since their bank president allowed it. It seemed silly to require business casual or more for all employees since the KC Fed is not a typical bank. There are no customers or clients coming in each day."

When you hit 200% of your goal they email store manager to find out why you are above goal and why was that goal assigned, instead of recognizing excellent sales ability. Payouts are the lowest I've ever seen at a financial institution. They have clawbacks when customers close/chargeoff accounts within 90 days which means they take away all your work (sales) for those accounts and make you double the work to catch back up. They don't run Chex Systems so that happens ALOT. Their technology lets just say is something to laugh about.  Oh can't forget about their hold time for Bank Support, Fraud Management, or Collection Dept is on average an hour so you are literally helping 5 customers a day for service instead of actually making sales.

Recently they started an entire purge of teachers if they don't comply with their new invasive background checks made by a third party without giving any knowledge as to how this really personal and private data is processed and who it is shared with. Accounts of the teachers who didn't comply were deactivated, posts on the teacher's forum where people were just asking honest questions about this situation were deleted and many people who were desperate enough to comply also lost their accounts (and often their main source of income) because the website of the company making the checks had various technical issues that didn't allow some people to complete them. I've read a few heart-wrenching pleas of teachers about to lose all of their students either because they didn't feel safe with a random company acquiring all their data or because they couldn't complete the check due to technical problems with the website or because they lived in countries where it might not have been safe to do so. Some teachers based in the UK asked if they could simply complete a DBS check but that of course didn't satisfy verbling either. Not only does this shady practise affects teachers' lives but students as well, because - surprise! - none of them were given refunds! Without any notice they were just given their verbling credit back and had their classes cancelled without any explanation when their teacher's account was deactivated. If they are learning a less popular language there are often no other teachers available so they can't transfer that credit to someone else and even if they can it's still highly unethical not to offer a refund. Considering how much verbling pushed students to buy 10 or 20 hours packages many students lost hundreds of dollars that they can't get back. What's most upsetting about this whole situation is how completely unnecessary it is - I've never heard of anything like that happening on any other teaching platform. I have no idea what happened to Verbling but the way they currently conduct their business is ethically questionable at best."

147,5,Fast Growing Company With a Lot of Opportunity for Growth,"CommCorp has made strides in their dei efforts, which makes the workplace culture inclusive and supportive. They actively encourage people from all backgrounds to apply and provide ongoing training for everyone to feel valued. The best part is that there are plenty of opportunities for growth and advancement within the organization. I've been able to take on new responsibilities and learn new skills to advance in my career. Overall, if you're looking for a great place to work that values DEI and offers room for growth, I highly recommend Commonwealth Corporation.","There had been a lot of shifts and growth lately and if you don't understand the strategies being implemented, it can feel like a lot of change, especially in a remote environment. Work/life balance can also be hard to manage because everyone is so passionate."
721,2,Unstable work place,"challenging technical environment, lots to learn and interesting technology",No oversite of mid level managers.   if they don't properly allocate resources the staff gets canned.   No support with the substantial learning curve.   Mentoring is a joke
932,1,Awful Management,"Easy job, commission as an associate is good. Some stores have good people to work with. Easy to get hired at most places.","District Manager for where I worked was inconsistent, the store managers changed every few months. 

The DMs mistakes are your fault.

Turnover rate is very high. Expect to get called in on your days off. 

They will treat you as lesser if you can't work 6-7 days a week.

The computer systems are very old and most logs are still on paper.

They will not train you properly at most stores.

If you're a keyholder, you better have experience because they will not tell you how to open or close, they will give you the answers to the training test and tell you they'll actually teach you later, but then they won't.

If you have an issue with management, they will not give you a chance to respond. 

If a customer complains, they will hold it against you and never speak to you directly, or just not inform you at all until its convenient for them to do so.

They only schedule 2 people a shift, even while training. Store managers will get yelled at for OT during this too.

They have one guy managing a ton of stores where I'm at, and he doesn't pay attention or listen to anyone other than the store manager, unless it's convenient for him to do so.

When my former store manager walked out due to declining mental health and stress, the DM tried to manipulate them into coming back.

The pay for every position is abysmal. Associates make minimum wage, but because they are usually at the register and make 7% commission, they often make more than the keyholders, who are usually doing shipment/cleaning because the associates are not trained properly. 

The store manager position usually starts at less than 16 an hour.

The store is always a mess and the DM would complain about it but wouldn't give us the time or people to clean it up.

The management does not care about their employees.

All of the shoes are on the floor so they will be stolen and damaged by customers daily. People will leave trash and empty boxes everywhere.

The dress code is outdated, they make you buy your own shirt if they don't have any, they have an order form to get shirts but they either never did it or you have to pay for them. 

Dress code is only enforced by DM, and they don't even list it properly on the paperwork.

The store manual is also outdated, and the DM told us not to follow it."
740,1,Not worth it,"Free food, and great friends","This place does no care for students at all, with out them this place wouldn’t even exist. We are just disposable to them. They work us like crazy have no care for our school work. They expect 110% every single day no matter what, your school schedule is completely ignored. The hire ups and completely unprofessional but expect you to be with us insane."
660,1,Discriminatory Performance Evaluation Practice to Foreign Employees,"Tons of company resources, great benefits, amazing infrastructure","This company lures foreign recruits to come work at their Korea HQ with competitive salaries.  Unfortunately, they do not tell you that there is a double standard for performance evaluations.   They never communicated this ahead of time. There was no transparency at all.  Foreigners are evaluated at a higher standard because of their higher incomes.  You want to hold foreigners at higher standard because of their higher pay? then give them a higher position that would be aligned with their salary so that they can deliver on higher expectations.  This is discriminatory.  Their bait and switch practice is very questionable and incredibly unfair"

Onboarding was an onslaught, management was pushing hard for releases of many features at once vs. focusing more than one dev on a feature at a time. As a Junior I was told to ask lots of questions and lean in to any process or learning, which we all did, and that would be enough. Kept meeting with managers to get feedback but basically got ""do better"". Eventually my manager stepped down, so the team was disorganized at the end.

I was let go in the first wave of cuts they did, the explanation was that I did not have enough technical knowledge to work there. But I had asked for help and direction for over 3 months, and passed their technical exam during interviews no problem.

*Equity is a buzzword-Favoritism applied to promotional opportunities. Exceptions are always made for those closely connected to CPO/CHRO
*DEI is a buzzword: when there is high turn over among your black and brown employees to include your DEI leader that’s a red flag
*Retaliation: Leaders dissect low engagement results to try and identify who said what vs holding themselves accountable and trying to fix it.
*Lack of respect for boundaries: Common to receive slacks and texts while on OOO
*Lack of true strategic growth mind set. Reactive and Inefficient: if it’s the most backwards time consuming way of doing things…that’s usually the path forward

Excellent cafeteria food. Free Parking.
Good culture for politicians.","Management identifies ""scape goats"" early in career and blames them for when projects are not set up to succeed. Management does not take accountability at all. Ultimately scape goats are put into an HR corrective action and fired.

Even if you are identified as a good steady performer then it is a matter of time before you get laid off. They only want to keep the top 35% of the work force.

Overtime is expected without compensation.
You are expected to ""volunteer"" for extra work and if you do not then you will get a bad review.

- The people are, without exception, some of the kindest, most empathetic and focused colleagues I've ever worked with. I always knew that any task someone was working on was going to be executed with maximum effort and care. 

- Solid and repeatable commercial model which incentivises 'good' behaviour and prioritises service efficacy

- Good focus on employee wellbeing

- Some truly remarkable successes and that's a testament to the model, the technology and the entire team. 

- A lot of trust from management enables a lot of great work that most don't even see.","Overall, a very positive experience, most issues are going to be common for organisations this size and anyone joining will need an element of patience while the org grows into the sector, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from joining. 

- Can feel a little too much like 'move fast and break things' at times

- Feedback is generally acted on, but sometimes not visibly or quickly - there's no faster way to lose trust than to make people feel like they're not listened to.

- Volume and pace of work forces team to be reactive more often than necessary... hiring has been a struggle (not unique to Beam) and a reason for this: If you think you'll need someone to do a job in a year, starting looking for them now."

HR tries to keep it in check but some people slip in the same department, unfairly might I add (no real interview conducted). 
-management team focuses too much on production numbers that creates a toxic environment among the workers, accuracy goes down because everyone is too busy trying to go faster than the person next to them. This is in regards to the laboratory. I can’t speak for the other departments. 
-good luck trying to move up past a lab tech. A lot of people don’t last simply due to the verbal abuse and toxicity just from the lead. They don’t train you further than what your job tasks are because of their “job security” (they can’t replace me if I’m the only one that knows how to work this machine).
-the “tyrant” mentioned in previous reviews no longer works there but there’s probably another tyrant in the works. Don’t know if it’s a power trip from recent developments in the company but there are a lot of choices made and head turning without consulting anyone else in the management team. 
-In an attempt to get the lab personnel to be more motivated to do better in their job so the company can thrive financially there was a meeting to go over goals and the “bigger” picture. During a debate about the importance of employee moral, the CEO inadvertently said “employees don’t need to be happy in order for the company to make revenue. Look at Amazon”.

2. Extremely boomer company with mindset of becoming FinTech. The whole company is filled with boomers who barely even trust millenials doing work. The amount of times my ideas were rejected because they were ""unprofessional, not corporate enough, not right"". The boomers love to ask for your suggestions and ideas but end up using their own because thats what they think is best :)

3. Cheapo company. 0 employee welfare - Your options at the pantry: Water (hot/cold). That's about it. Company earns millions a year but can barely afford to buy simple snacks and drinks for employees? No wonder turnover rate so high. Even the coffee at the coffee machine also must pay. Expects employees to OT but cannot provide simple employee welfare. Did I mention no OT pay as well? Oh yea they give u $5 meal allowance when you OT at CBD office (chicken rice also cost $7 la). 

Overall company is a sinking ship imo, get your boomers to change their mindset or its all over for Phillip. Gen Zs are entering the workforce and you will need them to stay in trend, good luck retaining any of your current interns."

Work/life balance is fine.","Engineers generally have a lower status at Mailchimp than at other tech companies, I think by design. One consequence for engineers is that their advancement depends more than is typical on their ability to please people without much insight into their jobs. Also, a lot of current technical leaders might have been great at bootstrapping a small company, but I don’t think they’re suited to technical leadership at a company of Mailchimp’s current size.

This company is evolving, but they have brought on more support to assure finding your move-ins for the family advisors.

Let's not forget what this company has done during the peak of a pandemic, for their employees and families making sure they were taken care of.

796,1,zero stars really should be an option for this place…,Coworkers were the best. Under appreciated yet still so loyal and hard working.,"Where to even start. 
First, I am typically not a person to leave a bad review, talk badly about places or people openly on the internet, or complain about working hard. I love hard work, I value hard work, and I was so excited to work somewhere that had the same values. I am also very active in the CrossFit community and was looking forward to being a part of the very beginning and heart of what makes CrossFit, CrossFit. Unfortunately, I left feeling like an object. Less than a number. A tally on a sheet that was ultimately deemed “overstaffed” (yes, they had an excel sheet viewable that told you whether you were considered under or over staffed). 
While I spent the majority of my 1.5 years in my role putting up with the constant pay cuts, lack of planning, asinine performance reviews, insane overtime during the holidays, denied PTO requests, virtually no training for new hires or other employees moving around, and egotistical managers, I stayed. I told myself I was apart of something special. While they shoved us in the trenches, we all remained loyal and continued to work hard—and good. Many people were approved to continue working remotely from “approved” states, some even being told the approval came straight from Caity. When we were told to come back to the office or be fired, no exception was given for people with special circumstances (ie military spouse). For a veteran owned company and claiming to be so “military friendly” this disgusted mostly everyone.
 Any conversation with a higher level manager about concerns resulted in a lecture while they tried to convince you in any way possible to make it make sense…. and they were ALWAYS right, even when they were wrong. Every conversation was left feeling like a scorned child who embarrassed their parent in public. 
Performance reviews were basically pointless and showed no linear progression of your actual work or performance. There was virtually no feedback and half of management doesn’t even know what you do. When asking why my score went down, I was told it was still an “excellent score” and I shouldn’t care. “you should have never got the first score to begin with (from a previous manager) because it’s unrealistic for your position” was what I was told. 
The pay cuts were a huge talking point, and I somewhat understood some of the cuts post Covid. By the end, the “competitive wage” they boast about was not competitive. But if you check out the prize purse for their event and athletes, you’ll clearly see where all of the employee cuts went. 

I could go on forever, but what sealed the deal was when I sent my resignation, not a single member of management so much as acknowledged it. I was left on my last day questioning if they even knew it was my last day. The cherry on top was none of management said a word to me on my last day, with the exception of my shift supervisor. If that doesn’t show they literally DONT CARE about you, I can’t convince you anything would. 
I even waited weeks to post this review, thinking maybe I was crazy and every place of employment acts this way. After my first few weeks at a new job I can confidently say Rogue is the worst workplace I’ve ever experienced. No one should treat their employees the way they have and get away with it. I genuinely hope their facade comes crumbling down."
86,1,avoid at all cost!,some perks included free breakfasts and free cinema tickets,"This is for DMS UK located in London Bridge, United Kingdom.

A highly unprofessional company that is predominantly based on the labour of graduates or young people with little to no experience.

The company does not value experience and does not want to pay experienced staff what they deserve.

Employees are overburdened with work and constantly put under very tight, almost unreasonable, deadlines. There is no appreciation at all, no equal treatment, no internal training: just a constant flow of requests. 

The company expects employees to work overtime more often than not, to skip lunch breaks and, in general, to finish late.

There is a high level of turnover, partly due to the fact that employees do not pass their probation period and the company does not offer valid reasons for their dismissal. 

One of the worst, if not the worst company I ever worked for."
243,1,Weak leadership and deep-rooted problems,"- Fantastic colleagues. Some of the best people I’ve ever worked with
- Nice office in a great location
- You are given meaningful responsibility quickly
- Slick marketing and brand","Scratch beneath the surface and there are a ton of red flags:

- The business is creaking under an enormous amount of tech debt. The C-suite refuse to engage with this problem as they have a poor grasp of technical concepts (and won’t listen to anyone who understands it), which means tech debt gets consistently deprioritised.

- High turnover in engineering leadership roles. Plus Freetrade has been without a CTO for 1.5 years now. Huge red flag for a tech company.

- Nobody in the C-suite has experience scaling a company at this stage of growth and it shows. The CEO has made a lot of bad bets in the past 1-2 years, takes almost no accountability for them and is clearly way out of his depth.

- Freetrade had an early mover advantage but the competition has come on leaps and bounds while Freetrade’s app has stagnated.

- The C-suite don’t care about employees. During the recent redundancy process they rescinded job offers, lied to employees about the number of redundancies needed (the figure turned out to be 2.5x higher than initially quoted), extended all probations so people made redundant would only get paid 1 week’s notice, etc.

- Lousy comms from leadership. The responses to recent reviews on here are a good example: zero empathy, lots of buzzwords, and not directly addressing concerns/criticisms that are raised."

During the interview process they make you believe the company is progressive, you will have the opportunity to be apart of something, and that you are helping the community. Truth is, it’s a money grab to enrich the upper management. For a company that has no other viable income sources (except the cable company fees residents pay) and has not developed anything to bring in new income they make an exorbitant amount of money. If you want to verify, It’s a nonprofit you can look up the incomes.
If you become an employee, upper management works very hard at distancing themselves from their employees, there is no respect for your talents, or your professional opinion. The staff is unhappy and the culture is toxic. There is a vindictive attitude towards employees, especially if you leave, so don't think you can ever use them as a reference for future employment.
When employees leave the organization, their positions are usually not replaced and other departments are forced to absorbed their workload with no change in salary. Only a select few get raises or title changes and there is little to no upward mobility in the company. 
The CEO micromanages everyone, let that sink in. You may ask how does he get his job done, the answer is he doesn’t. He prevents dept. heads from doing their jobs, so in comparison he looks stellar. When he has to make important decisions he freezes up and makes no decision until he is pushed. If the idea is not his, he will reject it and then reintroduce the idea as his own, with new semantics.
 
My advice to you, find another place you can grow."

-inner-circle politics 

-complete dysfunction in their leadership “tactics” stemming from how the CEO handles his employees. It’s as if they have to read “how to manage” before responding. 

They will always respond to your question with a question. 
-CEO has a complete disregard for the integrity of his employees and will publicly do so in front of the entire company. 

-As a startup, there is no organizational dynamic (or how one should act to be successful). It’s constantly being made up as they go. There is no structure — promotions are based off of “feel” and “personality” and not work performance.

Legally I could have left because the email sent out was for working on Saturday it never said to work on Friday afternoon. Also regarding the employee that sleeps on the job was never mentioned. Read the handbook pg80 the last sentence. To the one that answered my review this proves it depends on who you are. You should also check the AR department 3 major companies would be leaving 84 Lumber if they knew how their accounts were handled. This could be a huge problem for 84 Lumber.

They just showed me my office and told me to wait until a client walked in. -Super low employee morale, incredibly high turnover. I was made to feel completely replaceable the entire time I was there. LIHI makes no effort when it comes to retention, they just accept that people will leave after a short time and then complain about their retention issues. -Gossipy/""mean girl"" culture among upper management. Lack of transparency about who your supervisor is/who you report to. Supervisory relationships can be incredibly tense. -The new structure where property management supervises Case Managers is morally wrong and counter productive. CMs are now expected to ""help"" with evictions, collection of past due rent, etc. There were times when I felt like I was being punished for advocating for a tenant when I was really just doing what I felt like I was supposed to do based on my job description. -Unclear expectations. Written policies are either nonexistent or inaccessible. If you ask someone a question you are often passed around to different people and no one has an answer. -Because of the retention issue, they are often desperate and it seems like they will hire literally anyone. Some of my coworkers were amazing and some of them didn't want to be there at all-- LIHI doesn't care. Unqualified employees/employees who don't do their job are ignored while employees who go above and beyond to help residents are targeted and punished. -General lack of compassion for the population being served. If you care deeply about housing first/harm reduction, you will not find many likeminded people here. I was genuinely appalled at the way that some staff and supervisors would talk about residents behind closed doors, and even to their faces. The focus is on money. Residents who are too ""problematic"" (addiction, mental health challenges) are targeted for eviction and as a supportive services employee I often felt powerless to help once property management decided that someone needed to be evicted. Armed security is present at many buildings-- residents have been tased and verbally harassed. Too much reliance on law enforcement for an organization that claims to value trauma informed care. -Each property feels incredibly isolated from all others. In my entire time with LIHI I interacted with staff from other properties only a handful of times. There is no feeling of community in the organization as a whole, so if you enjoy your time or not is really dependent on the property you are placed at."

Anyone who doesn't manage up to them is managed out, but of course the resulting mass exodus of talent is blamed on people who haven't worked there in almost two years. Simply put there are way too many fragile egos and insecurities in play at the management and executive level to ever allow the folks on the ground to actually get anything done.

881,2,"Good company overall, disappointing tech team","The benefits were great, and honestly the rest of the company outside of the tech side of things seemed to have their ducks in a row. 

Unlimited PTO was nice, but some people definitely abused it.

Outside of this, they like to pay pretty far below market for development talent so make sure you don't sell yourself short when negotiating pay.","Overall, the tech team was a chaotic mess and had extremely high turnover during my brief time with this company, which meant all of the remaining team members got constantly shuffled around between different teams. I think I saw 8 people on the tech team leave over the course of 6-7 months? One of them had been with the company for 4 years and couldn't get promoted despite being one of their best tech team members, so he left. Big red flag when a company doesn't promote their employees but keeps hiring on new ones at a higher salary rate. 
Also, the bar on productivity was set so incredibly low here. This is, on the flip side, a great place to work for lazy devs who are tired of keeping up with new technology changes, or sunsetting devs who are ready to cruise into retirement. Or hey, if you're into being overemployed, this is one of those jobs that would be great for it. 

I really have no ill-will towards this company even though they pretty much lied to me during the interview process as far as the role I was getting hired on to do and the work that I actually ended up doing, which was mainly Microsoft Dynamics work and very, very little coding. I just want to warn any future prospective employees that they should set their expectations pretty low if they get hired on here. Or, at the very least, make sure you ask good questions during the interview process to be certain you really know what you're getting yourself in to. I certainly didn't and I wish someone would have warned me."
231,1,"Stay away from Siemens Government! Undervalued, underpaid, disorganized!","Absolutely none. I've worked as a government contractor for a decade, and this was the worst experience of my career. Stay away!","Extremely disorganized, constantly going under reorganization, no work-life balance, routine late-night calls that turned into lectures if you didn't answer, regular 60+ hour work weeks, little to no guidance, no file organization, no communication, pay and benefits don't compare to competitors, lack of infrastructure and resources to support remote employees"
490,1,Run as fast as you can!,"There are still some amazing people working there, even though most of the best ones have already fled the sinking (pirate)ship. There's no more pirate ship, just a floating life boat...","Oh boy, where do I begin? 

Management ( mostly upper, but also some middle ) is composed of highly incompetent people that eventually will ruin everything. 

Promotions happen only if the manager likes you and there have been several cases of people promoted into management over night and without any interviews or tests, just because a senior manager has been pulling the right strings. 

HR has no power - I hope I'll never see any other company like this, where HR says no to promoting a shady person as manager and nobody listens to them.

No empathy to their employees - the last round of layoffs was done just before the holiday season. Just imagine celebrating Christmas knowing this was your last paycheck...

Compensation below market. But somehow, if your salary is ok for a senior you are expected to work day and night only because there's a junior in your team who makes half of your paycheck. The manager will tell you repeatedly that you are paid a higher amount, so you need to prove that you deserve it. 

Work/life balance is a nightmare in some departments, while others do nothing for days in a row. People in specific departments were being overworked even before all the layoff rounds, so now it's simply unbearable. 

Female employees are often undervalued and unappreciated - especially in tech positions. Somehow being a good engineer can only happen if you are a male. That is also another toxic management trait. 

They hire now, only to kick people out - sometimes even in weeks time. If you are looking for a job, search further. 

If you are still there and you are not looking for a job you better start, before you find out you are on the next layoff list."
773,1,Awful,There’s nothing particularly good to say,Terrible company avoid. Management would not visit site offices for 6 months. Bit of a sink or swim attitude when I started and had to get my footing quickly.

289,5,good enivornment,team work and support system,no downsides to the company
419,1,Do Not Recommend,"Really great coworkers and team leads
There’s a lot of fun company events and contests.","I ’ll start by saying the biggest issue at JFQ is the training department. It’s no secret that most of the trainers have little to no mortgage experience or experience training people in general. Senior processing training is basically just one week, they focus completely on streamlines but even that training is minimal. Once you’re “out on the floor” you’re straight up told not to ask questions and to Google before approaching a lead. Eventually they start assigning you conventional and full doc loans without warning when you haven’t been trained on them at all - leadership expects you to work them without making any mistakes. It seems like there’s a big disconnect on what is covered during senior training and what isn’t, I could tell senior processing leads would get frustrated with the lack of proper training new seniors were getting.
This leads to the second issue, job security. Turnover is HIGH - either people leave unhappy or they’re fired without reason. The last few months there have been mass firings, entire departments let go yet they claim they’re not having money issues? 
Pay is horrible and way below the industry average. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere."
675,1,It's a starter job,Decent benefits package right when hired.,Upper management cares more about getting new products in-house than solving problems with existing products lines. You literally have to follow the demands of the customers to make them happy rather than do what's right to have a successful production line.
392,1,"Save your life, Abort! Abort! Do not join even if it your last option",You get a job easily here,"1. They micro manage like anything. You are questioned if you are idle from CRM for even a single minute
2. They deduct half day salary if metrics are not met on daily basis. The manager doesn't even approve the attendance if metrics are not met and you will be marked absent
3. No consideration for you as a resource. They think you are robots who can work 24X7. All they care about is your revenue
4. Your job is safe till the day you are getting revenue. Once that stops, you are fired. I have seen top performers of one quarter getting fired in the next one as their revenue dried up. In short, there is no consideration for your contributions in the past. All they care for is how much revenue you are getting today
5. Even the CEO and other founders only talk about revenue figures in the Org Wide Townhalls
6. You may have to work all 7 days of the week at times and if you luckily get 1 day off, you will be pressurized to get more revenue on DMs on your day off
7. The HR in the Org is just there to hire and fire people. They don't believe in building a good culture"
593,1,Toxic,Work with a team but you are working against each other most times so not a great pro,They hire and see who’s “mental stamina” can handle the sales workhorse environment. The competition is toxic not encouraging.
499,5,Outstanding company,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I felt compelled to write about the truth of this organization. I worked in the Charlotte office for only 2 months, April and May 2014.  I left because an opening in my previous field opened up and I took it. However, from day one, this was a professional organization. The Branch Manager in Charlotte is a class act, and all she asked is that each employee gives a 100% effort ( As any successful manager would ask ). The office had a team feel to it, as well as the entire company. The VP of Sales was always available to speak with, and to help in any way he could. The owner truly cares about his employees, his stated goal is to be the best payroll company, not the biggest, and he vocalized this to each employee personally. What an outstanding concept in today's fast paced business environment.",There were no cons to this job.

In fact, given the horror stories I hear when I meet with colleagues still working there - the forced ranking is still there: zero bonuses even when goals are exceeded. No tolerance for employees that want to take career risks and try new areas for growth: if the fit turns out to be a poor fit - you are labeled ""no internal moves"" and you time at MS is over.

792,5,Stellar engineering culture,"- The overall culture is healthy, active and engaging. 
- Some very smart, hardworking and genuinely nice engineers work here. This was a major benefit for me.
- CTO knows what he's doing and is of a caliber usually found in FAANG companies. I benefited enormously from working with him. 
- The turnover rate in engineering is very low, around 5% per year. 
- Two days per week in the office and 2 months per year where you can work from anywhere in the world.
- The team promotes people from within when possible. 
- Systems are of high/very high quality made by engineers who care.
- The only place I've seen that does major scale rewrites to get rid of technical debt. The serach function was a bit of a black hole and the company rewrote it six months ago. At some point 60% of the engineering team was involved. Tech debt here is taken seriously.
- CEO is a nice, approachable guy, always with a smile on his face and actively engages his employees, either 1:1 or through town hall meetings.","- Some of the tech leads could do with leadership/people skills training- an old problem in software engineering. There is an ongoing effort to address this with training etc, and there's an engineering manager promoted from within who seems to know what he's doing

879,1,"Unethical, impractical and hypocritical!",Great benefits and unfortunately that's it.,"The entire management for the most part in the HR department in the Houston corporate office is an absolute joke.  There are a few still employed there who have made their way up the corporate ladder by simply lying and throwing others under the bus continuously.  It is an absolute joke that no one cares enough to see what actually occurs in this department even when complaints are continuously raised.  Employees are led to believe that claims of harassment, bullying and various ethics violations will be investigated.  They aren't and the company always sides with management.  You will work tirelessly all day every day even on your days off only to have your managers claim your work and success as your own.  Many times you will be told that promotions are in the near future but why would you ever move up if your supervisors can keep you down because you continually make them look good?  Myself and several colleagues on the same level gave everything to BHP Billiton for years only to have them toss us to the curb when we no longer fit in their plans and the oil prices continued to slide.  It makes sense when you're trying to cut the bottom line and keep certain mid level managers who have never done a thing for the company and are absolutely over paid!"

Also sat next to some of the nicest Capital Market Technology PM ladies I have ever met. Self-initiated study led to my learning vasts amounts of knowledge on US and Canadian regulations, particularly Dodd-Frank Act which I will now transfer to my next contracting gig. Hours were also quite stable.","Was hired to be a senior Project Management for a massive, company-wide US regulatory initiative. During interview and first day, was again advised I should expect loads of work and travel. Despite asking daily for an opportunity to work on anything (even if not meaningful), I received little to no direction yet whenever I was proactive, I was usually reprimanded for doing something not asked for. My manager and his program manager lacked collaboration and communication skills. It was the first time I met a lawyer who was so in-methodical and disorganized. The entire project group faced constant criticisms from all business partners daily as a result. Program Manager was openly hostile in meetings with business partners and other PMs. I was kept on-board for several months before being let go for ""not meeting work requirements""."

456,4,An honest truth for my time with WPG,"I'm a little confused about why the marketing team has many great creative minds yet fails to get the recognition they deserve in these reviews. When a skill was missing that wasn't yet in the quiver, WPG quickly recognized and made smart hires to address those needs. 

The most considerable pro to my tenure on the marketing team would be that Jennifer and her team hire professionals and quickly trust their decisions as subject matter experts in the digital space. I can speak to being challenged to think more significantly, leverage instruments to exceed expectations, and the inspiration to bring meaningful solutions to problems we identified. 

During my time with the WPG Brands team, we shifted the mindset from acting as a thermometer and understanding when tension was elevating into a thermostat which allowed for fluid adjustment to act calm when faced with difficulty. This shift was made possible with the leadership of Kimberly. She served as a conductor that turned a series of loud noises into a steady tempo through the shuttering of both Shelby's and Tangible Collective brands.","No company is perfect, which is why this earned a 4-star review. My most significant drawback is that WPG did not set itself up for success within the digital landscape. As I signed off my computer for my next adventure, a distant digital light was at the end of the tunnel, and I am confident it will only grow in the coming years. Unfortunately, WPG couldn't cash in on years of website data to better understand the content driving the communities in the town centers that fund commerce. I wish there had been an opportunity to stay longer and build the digital real estate."

Go getters leave after they have a year or two of experience leaving the dregs for employees.  Unenlightened managment.  Management does not adjust to the market place.  As soon as someone figures out how to eat their cheese they are done but it will require the smaller more agile firms to lobby congress to remove the benefits that congress gives to larger banks.  They dont really have a path to the future.  They are not a technological company yet they thought at one time they could sell server backup space to their banking clients.

You also are pretty much not allowed to have any other engagements besides working there because it's a seven day bank. The company is so sales driven and treats their employees so badly that we were forced to cold call businesses begging them to open accounts with the bank. They also cut staff so badly that every single day the branches are struggling to help their customers, lines out the door with customer complaints. Oh and when the customers get called to rate the bank and your name is attached to their transaction, you get in trouble because the bad experience is your fault not the fact the bank refuses to fully staff their stores. When I first started it was the best job, it quickly became the most stressful job I've ever had and made me hate what I was doing for work. So happy I left this bank and I am never returning."

Don't bother going to your manager or HR, they will literally tell you ""I'm tired"" because they are too worried about their own agenda to protect junior female employees.

In the absence of technology, processes and any form of standards, they solely rely on heroics. Unless you are a banner level client, you'll get little attention or support. 

A lack of upward mobility (unless you are skilled at pandering to c-suite), preferential treatment and unheralded promotions at the whims of management. Unfathomable amounts of broken promises and platform flaws with the only explanation, if you can call it that, from management is a cop out like ""things are tough"" or some other tired cliché. 

Management is either so invested in creating and selling a façade that things aren't bad, broken, failing (we're a happy family they say!) that they actually believe it or more alarming don't see the reality. Tech is broken or unstable, competitors are seizing up market share and new logos, turnover across departments is crippling and morale just sinks lower. Yet upper management will force a smile and say ""things are fine"" with better fortunes just around the corner. How long you believe the latter part is what you'll wrestle with before seeing the only logical choice which is to exit a company decaying from the inside."

367,1,Id rather stick foot in a blender and eat a foot smoothie for lunch than go back to XLN,Honestly the people. I managed to meet some amazing people (who have now all left!) and we are still friends,"A normal day in my job at XLN would start with the management screaming at you to get at least 25 card machines working when yesterday the sales team only managed to sell 5. Where they expected us to pluck the other 20 from I don't know (And I have a very good imagination.) We would then work very hard to get 5 or sometimes even magically get up to 7 from last min deals etc. To then have the manager throw their phone across the office, in a tantrum. Managers were also seen to stomp feet, bash computer mouse against their table and order very expensive perfume/jewellery to the office just to go around and show everybody what they bought. I feel I should also mention that on several occasions managers where heard telling members off staff that ''they did not understand'' (that 20 card machines had to be 'made live') because English was not their first language, and they should be ''grateful this country accepted you''. 
Along with this came promises of raises which never did and bogus insentives e.g. ''Sell 5 items and you get to go home early'' (this e-mail would be sent at about 5:30pm). 
We would also be made to feel guilty if we left on time and did not come in early. 
Safe to say that my brief 6 month stint at XLN has given me and my therapist A LOT to get through."

Those people single handedly began the destruction of REX with their ill informed ideas which included the disastrous concept of whole REX. The CEO didn't listen to the right people. He didn't listen to the agents that worked in the field. He often said REX is a tech company not a Real Estate company. A tech company whose website was a joke and whose app never worked properly. He failed this company but most importantly failed the good men and woman who worked for REX. On Friday REX laid off the majority of the remaining staff with NO severance pay.

Work from home opportunities","My most memorable CON is when the CEO told staff we needed to accept we work for a nonprofit and receive nonprofit pay or go work elsewhere. That is easy to say when you make $400k+ a year. Meanwhile your staff are paid way below industry average, don't receive any raises (not even cost of living raises) and cannot even be reimbursed for needed supplies while working from home because your monthly ""stipend"" doesn't cover all the costs.
Staff are overrun and overworked by members (in some cases verbally insulted and demoralized) on the regular without consequence. That's what happens though when you underappreciate and undertrain your staff while the organization spends millions to appease member leaders with lavish parties, flights and trips around the world, nights out drinking in clubs, etc which supports their large egos and poor behaviors.

There may be 'good teams' but you are expendable and they make it clear. Not a long term career place. Snake pit by NYT was accurate.

- Professional Development. I was pushed (sometimes we all need a push) and encouraged to grow and develop, and it made me more successful in my career. There is a competitive culture within CBI, so if you are interested in just meeting the bare minimum and not sharpening your skills, you will not thrive. 
- Your Voice is Heard. CBI embraces the Lencioni Pyramid. Conflict is ok (and honestly is necessary!) as long as it's handled appropriately. I always felt that I could voice my opinions and recommendations to management and that it was received well. Note here, there is a difference between just complaining to upper management, and bringing forward a problem with a proposed solution. If you just want to complain about problems, you won't be successful. 
- Opportunities to Shine. CBI is a small company and as such, there are plenty of opportunities for driven, smart individuals to make big accomplishments and truly set themselves apart. I feel that CBI provided ample opportunities for me to be recognized for the work I was doing and overall was great at acknowledging when employees were making an impact.","- Smaller company, means less competitive benefits and limitations to career growth."

If you do manage to get close to a deal, management will force you to change payment terms or contract years at the last minute. 

There is absolutely no company culture. I literally never met half the people on my team. Management has no interest in building a collaborative environment. 

There are no sales tools at all. GlobalData supposedly is a billion dollar company, but they couldn’t be bothered to invest in Salesforce admin, zoominfo, LinkedIn sales navigator, or any other standard sales enablement tool. They expect every rep to just magically find phone numbers and emails.

386,2,Systemic problems in IT,"The county is overall a good and enjoyable place to work; my rating reflects what it's like working in IT. 
One positive note is there have been some strides in user education around security.","So where to begin... the IT department is plagued by innumerable issues that are mostly self-inflicted.
Number one with a bullet is management, a team which has undergone a complete changeout over the last few years. One of the last competent managers, who was a calm voice of reason, retired early out of frustration with the new leadership.

There's been a tonal shift in department culture. Morale is low and the department's panicky management style encourages finger pointing and contention among the staff. There are unclear standards around change management, and how to work with other teams within the department that never get addressed. Everyone is on edge, and there’s repeat offenders who will belittle and disparage other staff in meetings.

They actually had a doctor, a business psychologist, come in a couple years ago to interview the staff in small groups. Feedback from the staff was almost unanimous, but it seemed like the doctor’s report and suggestions were thrown out since it was critical of the director and deputy director.

The department is stuck in gridlock. There are a lot of half-baked processes, and then new processes and new committees to figure out why the processes aren’t working. 
Have a question? Your direct manager will either be unavailable or won’t know how to help you because they’re unsure of the direction the director wants them to take, or they’ll point you to another manager who’s just as unconfident.

County staff have become unhappy with IT, and aren’t shy about sharing that with you when you work with them. I can’t blame them because it’s hard to get help or work just isn’t being done.
There’s a process for what projects you’re supposed to work on, but management will quickly shoehorn a different #1 priority project/issue onto your plate, usually weekly, or anytime there’s a fire caused by their poor planning or some highly visible problem that makes the department look bad. 

Your head will be spinning trying to track your time in tickets, a time log, your outlook calendar, and your time card (while making sure it’s properly coded to the right work order)."

2. Lots of high-quality technical infrastructure that you will gasp at if you've spent enough time developing on standard/enterprise software. 
3. High-quality technical process and an appreciation for best practices.
4. Amazing networking opportunities. Google interns come from and end up all over the place, so being an intern is a great opportunity to meet lots of different people.","1. Lack of real respect for individuals. This is a symptom of Google being a large company with incredible scope to pick and choose people, along with having many excellent people. You are treated well at the surface level because you were able to get through the interviews and meet the obligatory standards, but you are not treated as an individual outside of your team's breadth. In addition, while you don't see rank explicitly pulled very often, the company is very top-down in policy and culture. I doubt this is a Google-exclusive issue, and in fact it's very common in large companies across the world. It's certainly easier to ignore at Google than other places and you are pampered in a number of ways. If you want that sort of gritty individual respect from the organization, work at a small company. 

2. Intern-specific: for full-time conversion, interviews can overshadow contributions to individual host teams. Interns are often left with the decision of maximizing their acquisition of gainful skills and their contributions to the company, or passing up on an opportunity for full-time employment at Google. Interview skills in tech are, at higher levels, focused on things that may not be application-specific for the intern's project, even if they are working on something of significant business value. This is backwards: I can count on one hand the number of tech companies I've heard of that still do this."

As a temp I was able to have very minimal PTO and benefits, but my pay way very low. I have no bereavement time off so when my grandmother died of covid I had to take unpaid days off. Additionally during my year as a temp I accomplished the amount of work that would have gotten me promoted but as soon as I was given permanent employment, they erased everything I did as a temp. So I was a year behind my peers in terms of career advancement which obviously greatly affected my ability to take part in bigger projects and my pay was consistently lower than my peers even though I had the exact same amount of training and was performing at their level. And then when I finally was able to be promoted properly, they let me go in company wide lay offs 2 weeks later. This company spends their money on fancy offices and execs for appearances instead of actually valuing their employees. Since October of 2021 there have been at least 4 rounds of lay offs.

However, what pushed me over the edge and made me decide to write this review is the fact that I was sold a dream, and I feel I was deceived and lied to. My recruiter sold me a dream of making 65k on average during the first year. I made 0 (zero) in 2 months and quit. Lying about pay is common in the recruitment for sales positions, but it's still inexcusable, especially when the other firm I interviewed with, the local Coldwell Banker, was extremely honest with me and told me the average first year agent in their firm makes 17k their first year, which aligns with National averages. When I was reading these reviews, yes there were warnings but the warnings were too general, they could really be applicable to any and all real estate firms, and so I decided to sign on with Mark Spain. Originally about 10 people were recruited for our class. 7 didn't make it past the first Zoom meeting. Out of the 3 people left, it was me, a woman, and a frat boy who is literally still in college. First red flag. When the 3 of us first arrived at the office, it was in the same building a couple doors away from Raleigh Marketing Consultants, which is a branch office of Cydcor/Smart Circle, a well-known MLM pyramid scheme. Second red flag. The unpaid training is about 2 weeks. Before and during the training we were assigned to shadow 5 agents. I was the only one who didn't get any shadows before or during the training. Not sure if it was because I am Asian. When I emailed the director to ask why, I did not get a response for some time. She is very fast to respond to all emails, except on this one occasion. After our unpaid training, the woman quit, so it was just me and the frat boy. Now I have nothing against boys in frats, it's just this particular person takes every opportunity to remove his mask but on one occasion for reasons unknown he put on his mask when I came into the room. 2 months after training I guess I just had enough and wanted to make some money, so I quit. They play games. The first lead they gave me was someone who cancelled a month ago and never rescheduled, and they said oh what the heck give it to him. When I called to confirm the appointment, after doing hours of work, the lead said she had no idea of any appointments. After getting one joke lead after 2 months, I decided to quit. Right when I was about to quit, they tried to give me another lead. Even though I didn't have another job lined up, I was still not about to play that game, and I stuck to my guts and quit anyways. I now have a job making more money than I ever did ever before."

107,1,Burnout guaranteed,Great clinical variety/caseload. Loved the immediate team I was working with.,"A company that is happy to put profit over the wellbeing of their clients and clinicians. While the pay was terrible, the overburdening and undervaluing of staff was absolutely unacceptable. It was awful to see so many hard-working clinicians being run into the ground over unattainable billable hours, administrative tasks, reporting, marketing (yes, we were told to do our own marketing... Because why else pay for a Marketing Team) and managing the exhaustion of a taxing clinical workload. Can't imagine how a new grad would manage in such an environment. I abhor writing these sorts of reviews, but I feel obliged to hopefully stop any well-meaning clinician from tying themselves down to this company. Unrealistic KPIs, workplace expectations around billable hours do not allow for planning, collaboration or evidence-based practice. Terrible pay. Bonus scheme is impossible to benefit from. Poor communication from management. Constant micro-managing of schedules.

EDIT: Not an inclusive company - no flexibility or willingness to accommodate in a meaningful way for clinicians with disabilities."
271,4,Decent mid-sized Government Contractor,"Decent pay and benefits, real focus on training and corporate mobility, professional handling of COVID-19","Like all government contractors, work is based on the ebb and flow of federal budgets. Sometimes you get lucky and end up on a well-funded contract with plenty of quality work, sometimes not. Not really a CACI specific problem, just the nature of the business."

Great bonus",Would like a longer break
436,1,"Long Hours, Tight Pay, No Loyalty",The travel aspect was nice for the immediate short term.,"Pay is low and raises are nonexistent, you will work about 60+ hours per week on salary so no OT, the employees have cliques and are not very friendly or welcoming."
